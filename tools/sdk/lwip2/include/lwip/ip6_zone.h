 *
 * IPv6 address scopes, zones, and scoping policy.
 *
 * This header provides the means to implement support for IPv6 address scopes,
 * as per RFC 4007. An address scope can be either global or more constrained.
 * In lwIP, we say that an address "has a scope" or "is scoped" when its scope
 * is constrained, in which case the address is meaningful only in a specific
 * "zone." For unicast addresses, only link-local addresses have a scope; in
 * that case, the scope is the link. For multicast addresses, there are various
 * scopes defined by RFC 4007 and others. For any constrained scope, a system
 * must establish a (potentially one-to-many) mapping between zones and local
 * interfaces. For example, a link-local address is valid on only one link (its
 * zone). That link may be attached to one or more local interfaces. The
 * decisions on which scopes are constrained and the mapping between zones and
 * interfaces is together what we refer to as the "scoping policy" - more on
 * this in a bit.
 *
 * In lwIP, each IPv6 address has an associated zone index. This zone index may
 * be set to "no zone" (IP6_NO_ZONE, 0) or an actual zone. We say that an
 * address "has a zone" or "is zoned" when its zone index is *not* set to "no
 * zone." In lwIP, in principle, each address should be "properly zoned," which
 * means that if the address has a zone if and only if has a scope. As such, it
 * is a rule that an unscoped (e.g., global) address must never have a zone.
 * Even though one could argue that there is always one zone even for global
 * scopes, this rule exists for implementation simplicity. Violation of the
 * rule will trigger assertions or otherwise result in undesired behavior.
 *
 * Backward compatibility prevents us from requiring that applications always
 * provide properly zoned addresses. We do enforce the rule that the in the
 * lwIP link layer (everything below netif->output_ip6() and in particular ND6)
 * *all* addresses are properly zoned. Thus, on the output paths down the
 * stack, various places deal with the case of addresses that lack a zone.
 * Some of them are best-effort for efficiency (e.g. the PCB bind and connect
 * API calls' attempts to add missing zones); ultimately the IPv6 output
 * handler (@ref ip6_output_if_src) will set a zone if necessary.
 *
 * Aside from dealing with scoped addresses lacking a zone, a proper IPv6
 * implementation must also ensure that a packet with a scoped source and/or
 * destination address does not leave its zone. This is currently implemented
 * in the input and forward functions. However, for output, these checks are
 * deliberately omitted in order to keep the implementation lightweight. The
 * routing algorithm in @ref ip6_route will take decisions such that it will
 * not cause zone violations unless the application sets bad addresses, though.
 *
 * In terms of scoping policy, lwIP implements the default policy from RFC 4007
 * using macros in this file. This policy considers link-local unicast
 * addresses and (only) interface-local and link-local multicast addresses as
 * having a scope. For all these addresses, the zone is equal to the interface.
 * As shown below in this file, it is possible to implement a custom policy.
