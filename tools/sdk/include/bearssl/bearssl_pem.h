 * # PEM Support
 *
 * PEM is a traditional encoding layer use to store binary objects (in
 * particular X.509 certificates, and private keys) in text files. While
 * the acronym comes from an old, defunct standard ("Privacy Enhanced
 * Mail"), the format has been reused, with some variations, by many
 * systems, and is a _de facto_ standard, even though it is not, actually,
 * specified in all clarity anywhere.
 *
 * ## Format Details
 *
 * BearSSL contains a generic, streamed PEM decoder, which handles the
 * following format:
 *
 *   - The input source (a sequence of bytes) is assumed to be the
 *     encoding of a text file in an ASCII-compatible charset. This
 *     includes ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and UTF-8 encodings. Each
 *     line ends on a newline character (U+000A LINE FEED). The
 *     U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN characters are ignored, so the code
 *     accepts both Windows-style and Unix-style line endings.
 *
 *   - Each object begins with a banner that occurs at the start of
 *     a line; the first banner characters are "`-----BEGIN `" (five
 *     dashes, the word "BEGIN", and a space). The banner matching is
 *     not case-sensitive.
 *
 *   - The _object name_ consists in the characters that follow the
 *     banner start sequence, up to the end of the line, but without
 *     trailing dashes (in "normal" PEM, there are five trailing
 *     dashes, but this implementation is not picky about these dashes).
 *     The BearSSL decoder normalises the name characters to uppercase
 *     (for ASCII letters only) and accepts names up to 127 characters.
 *
 *   - The object ends with a banner that again occurs at the start of
 *     a line, and starts with "`-----END `" (again case-insensitive).
 *
 *   - Between that start and end banner, only Base64 data shall occur.
 *     Base64 converts each sequence of three bytes into four
 *     characters; the four characters are ASCII letters, digits, "`+`"
 *     or "`-`" signs, and one or two "`=`" signs may occur in the last
 *     quartet. Whitespace is ignored (whitespace is any ASCII character
 *     of code 32 or less, so control characters are whitespace) and
 *     lines may have arbitrary length; the only restriction is that the
 *     four characters of a quartet must appear on the same line (no
 *     line break inside a quartet).
 *
 *   - A single file may contain more than one PEM object. Bytes that
 *     occur between objects are ignored.
 *
 *
 * ## PEM Decoder API
 *
 * The PEM decoder offers a state-machine API. The caller allocates a
 * decoder context, then injects source bytes. Source bytes are pushed
 * with `br_pem_decoder_push()`. The decoder stops accepting bytes when
 * it reaches an "event", which is either the start of an object, the
 * end of an object, or a decoding error within an object.
 *
 * The `br_pem_decoder_event()` function is used to obtain the current
 * event; it also clears it, thus allowing the decoder to accept more
 * bytes. When a object start event is raised, the decoder context
 * offers the found object name (normalised to ASCII uppercase).
 *
 * When an object is reached, the caller must set an appropriate callback
 * function, which will receive (by chunks) the decoded object data.
 *
 * Since the decoder context makes no dynamic allocation, it requires
 * no explicit deallocation.
