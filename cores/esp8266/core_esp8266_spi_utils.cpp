/*  SPI0Command: send a custom SPI command.
 *  This part calculates register values and passes them to _SPI0Command().
 *  Parameters:
 *	cmd	The command byte (first 8 bits) to send to the SPI device
 *	*data	The buffer containing the outgoing data for the SPI bus.
 *		The data is expected to be mosi_bits long, and the buffer
 *		is overwritten by the incoming bus data, which will be
 *		miso_bits long.
 *	mosi_bits
 *		Number of bits to be sent after the command byte.
 *	miso_bits
 *		Number of bits to read from the SPI bus after the outgoing
 *		data has been sent.
 *  pre_cmd
 *    A few SPI Flash commands require enable commands to immediately preceed
 *    them. Since two calls to SPI0Command from ICACHE memory most likely would
 *    be separated by SPI Flash read request for iCache, use this option to
 *    supply a prefix command, 8-bits w/o read or write data.
 *
 *    Case in point from the GD25Q32E datasheet: "The Write Enable for Volatile
 *    Status Register command must be issued prior to a Write Status Register
 *    command and any other commands canâ€™t be inserted between them."
 *
 *  Note: This code has only been tested with SPI bus 0, but should work
 *        equally well with other buses. The ESP8266 has bus 0 and 1,
 *        newer chips may have more one day.
 *
 *  Supplemental Notes:
 *
 *  SPI Bus wire view: Think of *data as an array of bytes, byte[0] goes out
 *  first with the most significant bit shifted out first and so on. When
 *  thinking of the data as an array of 32bit-words, the least significant byte
 *  of the first 32bit-word goes out first on the SPI bus with the most
 *  significant bit of that byte shifted out first onto the wire.
 *
 *  When presenting a 3 or 4-byte address, the byte order will need to be
 *  reversed. Don't overthink it. For a 3-byte address, view *data as a byte
 *  array and set the first 3-bytes to the address. eg. byteData[0] MSB,
 *  byteData[1] middle, and byteData[2] LSB.
 *
 *  When sending a fractional byte, fill in the most significant bit positions
 *  of the byte first.
