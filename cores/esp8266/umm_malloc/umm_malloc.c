 *
 * ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 *
 * Joerg Wunsch and the avr-libc provided the first malloc() implementation
 * that I examined in detail.
 *
 * http: *www.nongnu.org/avr-libc
 *
 * Doug Lea's paper on malloc() was another excellent reference and provides
 * a lot of detail on advanced memory management techniques such as binning.
 *
 * http: *g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html
 *
 * Bill Dittman provided excellent suggestions, including macros to support
 * using these functions in critical sections, and for optimizing realloc()
 * further by checking to see if the previous block was free and could be
 * used for the new block size. This can help to reduce heap fragmentation
 * significantly.
 *
 * Yaniv Ankin suggested that a way to dump the current heap condition
 * might be useful. I combined this with an idea from plarroy to also
 * allow checking a free pointer to make sure it's valid.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The memory manager assumes the following things:
 *
 * 1. The standard POSIX compliant malloc/realloc/free semantics are used
 * 2. All memory used by the manager is allocated at link time, it is aligned
 *    on a 32 bit boundary, it is contiguous, and its extent (start and end
 *    address) is filled in by the linker.
 * 3. All memory used by the manager is initialized to 0 as part of the
 *    runtime startup routine. No other initialization is required.
 *
 * The fastest linked list implementations use doubly linked lists so that
 * its possible to insert and delete blocks in constant time. This memory
 * manager keeps track of both free and used blocks in a doubly linked list.
 *
 * Most memory managers use some kind of list structure made up of pointers
 * to keep track of used - and sometimes free - blocks of memory. In an
 * embedded system, this can get pretty expensive as each pointer can use
 * up to 32 bits.
 *
 * In most embedded systems there is no need for managing large blocks
 * of memory dynamically, so a full 32 bit pointer based data structure
 * for the free and used block lists is wasteful. A block of memory on
 * the free list would use 16 bytes just for the pointers!
 *
 * This memory management library sees the malloc heap as an array of blocks,
 * and uses block numbers to keep track of locations. The block numbers are
 * 15 bits - which allows for up to 32767 blocks of memory. The high order
 * bit marks a block as being either free or in use, which will be explained
 * later.
 *
 * The result is that a block of memory on the free list uses just 8 bytes
 * instead of 16.
 *
 * In fact, we go even one step futher when we realize that the free block
 * index values are available to store data when the block is allocated.
 *
 * The overhead of an allocated block is therefore just 4 bytes.
 *
 * Each memory block holds 8 bytes, and there are up to 32767 blocks
 * available, for about 256K of heap space. If that's not enough, you
 * can always add more data bytes to the body of the memory block
 * at the expense of free block size overhead.
 *
 * There are a lot of little features and optimizations in this memory
 * management system that makes it especially suited to small embedded, but
 * the best way to appreciate them is to review the data structures and
 * algorithms used, so let's get started.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * We have a general notation for a block that we'll use to describe the
 * different scenarios that our memory allocation algorithm must deal with:
 *
 *    +----+----+----+----+
 * c  |* n |  p | nf | pf |
 *    +----+----+----+----+
 *
 * Where - c  is the index of this block
 *         *  is the indicator for a free block
 *         n  is the index of the next block in the heap
 *         p  is the index of the previous block in the heap
 *         nf is the index of the next block in the free list
 *         pf is the index of the previous block in the free list
 *
 * The fact that we have forward and backward links in the block descriptors
 * means that malloc() and free() operations can be very fast. It's easy
 * to either allocate the whole free item to a new block or to allocate part
 * of the free item and leave the rest on the free list without traversing
 * the list from front to back first.
 *
 * The entire block of memory used by the heap is assumed to be initialized
 * to 0. The very first block in the heap is special - it't the head of the
 * free block list. It is never assimilated with a free block (more on this
 * later).
 *
 * Once a block has been allocated to the application, it looks like this:
 *
 *    +----+----+----+----+
 *  c |  n |  p |   ...   |
 *    +----+----+----+----+
 *
 * Where - c  is the index of this block
 *         n  is the index of the next block in the heap
 *         p  is the index of the previous block in the heap
 *
 * Note that the free list information is gone, because it's now being used to
 * store actual data for the application. It would have been nice to store
 * the next and previous free list indexes as well, but that would be a waste
 * of space. If we had even 500 items in use, that would be 2,000 bytes for
 * free list information. We simply can't afford to waste that much.
 *
 * The address of the ... area is what is returned to the application
 * for data storage.
 *
 * The following sections describe the scenarios encountered during the
 * operation of the library. There are two additional notation conventions:
 *
 * ?? inside a pointer block means that the data is irrelevant. We don't care
 *    about it because we don't read or modify it in the scenario being
 *    described.
 *
 * ... between memory blocks indicates zero or more additional blocks are
 *     allocated for use by the upper block.
 *
 * And while we're talking about "upper" and "lower" blocks, we should make
 * a comment about adresses. In the diagrams, a block higher up in the
 * picture is at a lower address. And the blocks grow downwards their
 * block index increases as does their physical address.
 *
 * Finally, there's one very important characteristic of the individual
 * blocks that make up the heap - there can never be two consecutive free
 * memory blocks, but there can be consecutive used memory blocks.
 *
 * The reason is that we always want to have a short free list of the
 * largest possible block sizes. By always assimilating a newly freed block
 * with adjacent free blocks, we maximize the size of each free memory area.
 *
 *---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Operation of malloc right after system startup
 *
 * As part of the system startup code, all of the heap has been cleared.
 *
 * During the very first malloc operation, we start traversing the free list
 * starting at index 0. The index of the next free block is 0, which means
 * we're at the end of the list!
 *
 * At this point, the malloc has a special test that checks if the current
 * block index is 0, which it is. This special case initializes the free
 * list to point at block index 1.
 *
 *    BEFORE                             AFTER
 *
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 * 0  |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |           0  |  1 |  0 |  1 |  0 |
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 *                                       +----+----+----+----+
 *                                    1  |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |
 *                                       +----+----+----+----+
 *
 * The heap is now ready to complete the first malloc operation.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Operation of malloc when we have reached the end of the free list and
 * there is no block large enough to accommodate the request.
 *
 * This happens at the very first malloc operation, or any time the free
 * list is traversed and no free block large enough for the request is
 * found.
 *
 * The current block pointer will be at the end of the free list, and we
 * know we're at the end of the list because the nf index is 0, like this:
 *
 *    BEFORE                             AFTER
 *
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 * pf |*?? | ?? | cf | ?? |           pf |*?? | ?? | lf | ?? |
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 *             ...                                ...
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 *  p | cf | ?? |   ...   |            p | cf | ?? |   ...   |
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 * cf |  0 |  p |  0 | pf |            c | lf |  p |   ...   |
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 *                                       +----+----+----+----+
 *                                    lf |  0 | cf |  0 | pf |
 *                                       +----+----+----+----+
 *
 * As we walk the free list looking for a block of size b or larger, we get
 * to cf, which is the last item in the free list. We know this because the
 * next index is 0.
 *
 * So we're going to turn cf into the new block of memory, and then create
 * a new block that represents the last free entry (lf) and adjust the prev
 * index of lf to point at the  block we just created. We also need to adjust
 * the next index of the new block (c) to point to the last free block.
 *
 * Note that the next free index of the pf block must point to the new lf
 * because cf is no longer a free block!
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Operation of malloc when we have found a block (cf) that will fit the
 * current request of b units exactly.
 *
 * This one is pretty easy, just clear the free list bit in the current
 * block and unhook it from the free list.
 *
 *    BEFORE                             AFTER

 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+  Clear the free
 * cf |* n |  p | nf | pf |           cf |  n |  p |   ..    |  list bit here
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+

 * nf |*?? | ?? | ?? | cf |           nf | ?? | ?? | ?? | pf |
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 *
 * Unhooking from the free list is accomplished by adjusting the next and
 * prev free list index values in the pf and nf blocks.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Operation of malloc when we have found a block that will fit the current
 * request of b units with some left over.
 *
 * We'll allocate the new block at the END of the current free block so we
 * don't have to change ANY free list pointers.
 *
 *    BEFORE                             AFTER

 *                                       +----+----+----+----+ This is the new
 *                                     c |  n | cf |   ..    | block at cf+b
 *                                       +----+----+----+----+
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 *  n | ?? | cf |   ...   |            n | ?? |  c |   ...   |
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+

 *
 * This one is prety easy too, except we don't need to mess with the
 * free list indexes at all becasue we'll allocate the new block at the
 * end of the current free block. We do, however have to adjust the
 * indexes in cf, c, and n.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * That covers the initialization and all possible malloc scenarios, so now
 * we need to cover the free operation possibilities...
 *
 * The operation of free depends on the position of the current block being
 * freed relative to free list items immediately above or below it. The code
 * works like this:
 *
 * if next block is free
 *   assimilate with next block already on free list
 * if prev block is free
 *   assimilate with prev block already on free list
 * else
 *   put current block at head of free list
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Step 1 of the free operation checks if the next block is free, and if it
 * is then insert this block into the free list and assimilate the next block
 * with this one.
 *
 * Note that c is the block we are freeing up, cf is the free block that
 * follows it.
 *
 *    BEFORE                             AFTER
 *

 *    +----+----+----+----+                                    assimilated with
 * cf |*nn |  c | nf | pf |                                    the next, and

 *
 * Take special note that the newly assimilated block (c) is completely
 * disconnected from the free list, and it does not have its free list
 * bit set. This is important as we move on to step 2 of the procedure...
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Step 2 of the free operation checks if the prev block is free, and if it
 * is then assimilate it with this block.
 *
 * Note that c is the block we are freeing up, pf is the free block that
 * precedes it.

 *
 * Nothing magic here, except that when we're done, the current block (c)
 * is gone since it's been absorbed into the previous free block. Note that
 * the previous step guarantees that the next block (n) is not free.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Step 3 of the free operation only runs if the previous block is not free.
 * it just inserts the current block to the head of the free list.
 *
 * Remember, 0 is always the first block in the memory heap, and it's always
 * head of the free list!

 *
 * Again, nothing spectacular here, we're simply adjusting a few pointers
 * to make the most recently freed block the first item in the free list.
 *
 * That's because finding the previous free block would mean a reverse
 * traversal of blocks until we found a free one, and it's just easier to
 * put it at the head of the list. No traversal is needed.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Finally, we can cover realloc, which has the following basic operation.
 *
 * The first thing we do is assimilate up with the next free block of
 * memory if possible. This step might help if we're resizing to a bigger
 * block of memory. It also helps if we're downsizing and creating a new
 * free block with the leftover memory.
 *
 * First we check to see if the next block is free, and we assimilate it
 * to this block if it is. If the previous block is also free, and if
 * combining it with the current block would satisfy the request, then we
 * assimilate with that block and move the current data down to the new
 * location.
 *
 * Assimilating with the previous free block and moving the data works
 * like this:
 *
 *    BEFORE                             AFTER
 *

 * Once we're done that, there are three scenarios to consider:
 *
 * 1. The current block size is exactly the right size, so no more work is
 *    needed.
 *
 * 2. The current block is bigger than the new required size, so carve off
 *    the excess and add it to the free list.
 *
 * 3. The current block is still smaller than the required size, so malloc
 *    a new block of the correct size and copy the current data into the new
 *    block before freeing the current block.
 *
 * The only one of these scenarios that involves an operation that has not
 * yet been described is the second one, and it's shown below:
 *
 *    BEFORE                             AFTER
 *
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 *  p |  c | ?? |   ...   |            p |  c | ?? |   ...   |
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 *  c |  n |  p |   ...   |            c |  s |  p |   ...   |
 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 *                                       +----+----+----+----+ This is the
 *                                     s |  n |  c |   ..    | new block at
 *                                       +----+----+----+----+ c+blocks

 *    +----+----+----+----+              +----+----+----+----+
 *
 * Then we call free() with the adress of the data portion of the new
 * block (s) which adds it to the free list.
