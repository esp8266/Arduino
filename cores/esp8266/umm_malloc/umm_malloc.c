 *
 * R.Hempel 2007-09-22 - Original
 * R.Hempel 2008-12-11 - Added MIT License biolerplate
 *                     - realloc() now looks to see if previous block is free
 *                     - made common operations functions
 * R.Hempel 2009-03-02 - Added macros to disable tasking
 *                     - Added function to dump heap and check for valid free
 *                        pointer
 * R.Hempel 2009-03-09 - Changed name to umm_malloc to avoid conflicts with
 *                        the mm_malloc() library functions
 *                     - Added some test code to assimilate a free block
 *                        with the very block if possible. Complicated and
 *                        not worth the grief.
 * D.Frank 2014-04-02  - Fixed heap configuration when UMM_TEST_MAIN is NOT set,
 *                        added user-dependent configuration file umm_malloc_cfg.h
 * R.Hempel 2016-12-04 - Add support for Unity test framework
 *                     - Reorganize source files to avoid redundant content
 *                     - Move integrity and poison checking to separate file
 * R.Hempel 2017-12-29 - Fix bug in realloc when requesting a new block that
 *                        results in OOM error - see Issue 11
