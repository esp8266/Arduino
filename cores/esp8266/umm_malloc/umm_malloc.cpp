 *
 * R.Hempel 2007-09-22 - Original
 * R.Hempel 2008-12-11 - Added MIT License biolerplate
 *                     - realloc() now looks to see if previous block is free
 *                     - made common operations functions
 * R.Hempel 2009-03-02 - Added macros to disable tasking
 *                     - Added function to dump heap and check for valid free
 *                        pointer
 * R.Hempel 2009-03-09 - Changed name to umm_malloc to avoid conflicts with
 *                        the mm_malloc() library functions
 *                     - Added some test code to assimilate a free block
 *                        with the very block if possible. Complicated and
 *                        not worth the grief.
 * D.Frank 2014-04-02  - Fixed heap configuration when UMM_TEST_MAIN is NOT set,
 *                        added user-dependent configuration file umm_malloc_cfg.h
 * R.Hempel 2016-12-04 - Add support for Unity test framework
 *                     - Reorganize source files to avoid redundant content
 *                     - Move integrity and poison checking to separate file
 * R.Hempel 2017-12-29 - Fix bug in realloc when requesting a new block that
 *                        results in OOM error - see Issue 11
 * R.Hempel 2019-09-07 - Separate the malloc() and free() functionality into
 *                        wrappers that use critical section protection macros
 *                        and static core functions that assume they are
 *                        running in a protected con text. Thanks @devyte
 * R.Hempel 2020-01-07 - Add support for Fragmentation metric - See Issue 14
 * R.Hempel 2020-01-12 - Use explicitly sized values from stdint.h - See Issue 15
 * R.Hempel 2020-01-20 - Move metric functions back to umm_info - See Issue 29
 * R.Hempel 2020-02-01 - Macro functions are uppercased - See Issue 34

     * "Is it safe"
     *
     * Is it safe to call from an ISR? Is there a point during a malloc that a
     * an interrupt and subsequent call to malloc result in undesired results?
     *
     * Heap selection in managed by the functions umm_push_heap, umm_pop_heap,
     * umm_get_current_heap_id, and umm_set_heap_by_id. These functions are
     * responsible for getting/setting the module static variable umm_heap_cur.
     * The umm_heap_cur variable is an index that is used to select the current
     * heap context. Depending on the situation this selection can be overriddened.
     *
     * All variables for a specific Heap are in a single structure. `heap_context`
     * is an array of these structures. Each heap API function uses a function
     * local variable `_context` to hold a pointer to the selected heap structure.
     * This local pointer is referenced for all the "selected heap" operations.
     * Coupled with critical sections around global data should allow the API
     * functions to be reentrant.
     *
     * Using the `_context` name throughout made it easy to incorporate the
     * context into existing macros.
     *
     * For allocating APIs `umm_heap_cur` is used to index and select a value for
     * `_context`. If an allocation is made from an ISR, this value is ignored and
     * the heap context for DRAM is loaded. For APIs that require operating on an
     * existing allocation such as realloc and free, the heap context selected is
     * done by matching the allocation's address with that of one of the heap
     * address ranges.
     *
     * I think we are safe with multiple heaps when the non32-bit exception
     * handler is used, as long as interrupts don't get enabled. There was a
     * window in the Boot ROM "C" Exception Wrapper that would enable interrupts
     * when running our non32-exception handler; however, that should be resolved
     * by our replacement wrapper. For more information on exception handling
     * issues for IRAM see comments above `_set_exception_handler_wrapper()` in
     * `core_esp8266_non32xfer.cpp`.
     *
     * ISRs should not try and change heaps. umm_malloc will ignore the change.
     * All should be fine as long as the caller puts the heap back the way it was.
     * On return, everything must be the same. The foreground thread will continue
     * with the same information that was there before the interrupt. All malloc()
     * requests made from an ISR are fulfilled with DRAM.
     *
     * For umm_malloc, heap selection involves changing a single variable that is
     * on the calling context stack. From the umm_mallac side, that variable is
     * used to load a context pointer by index, heap ID. While an umm_malloc API
     * function is running, all heap related variables are in the context variable
     * pointer, registers, or the current stack as the request is processed. With
     * a single variable to reference for heap selection, I think it is unlikely
     * that umm_malloc can be called, with things in an unusable transition state.
