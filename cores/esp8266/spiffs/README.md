## INTRODUCTION

Spiffs is a file system intended for SPI NOR flash devices on embedded targets.

Spiffs is designed with following characteristics in mind:
 - Small (embedded) targets, sparse RAM without heap
 - Only big areas of data (blocks) can be erased
 - An erase will reset all bits in block to ones
 - Writing pulls one to zeroes
 - Zeroes can only be pulled to ones by erase
 - Wear leveling


## FEATURES

What spiffs does:
 - Specifically designed for low ram usage
 - Uses statically sized ram buffers, independent of number of files
 - Posix-like api: open, close, read, write, seek, stat, etc
 - It can run on any NOR flash, not only SPI flash - theoretically also on embedded flash of a microprocessor
 - Multiple spiffs configurations can run on same target - and even on same SPI flash device
 - Implements static wear leveling 
 - Built in file system consistency checks
 - Highly configurable
 
What spiffs does not:
 - Presently, spiffs does not support directories. It produces a flat structure. Creating a file with path *tmp/myfile.txt* will create a file called *tmp/myfile.txt* instead of a *myfile.txt* under directory *tmp*. 
 - It is not a realtime stack. One write operation might last much longer than another.
 - Poor scalability. Spiffs is intended for small memory devices - the normal sizes for SPI flashes. Going beyond ~128Mbyte is probably a bad idea. This is a side effect of the design goal to use as little ram as possible.
 - Presently, it does not detect or handle bad blocks.
 - One configuration, one binary. There's no generic spiffs binary that handles all types of configurations.
