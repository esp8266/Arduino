/*
 * As far as I know, there is no way to get called for a Hardware WDT. I assume
 * it generates a form of reset that occurs at a low level that cannot be
 * trapped. Debugging an HWDT can be quite challenging.
 *
 * This module writes a stack dump to the serial port after a Hardware Watchdog
 * Timer has struck, and a new boot cycle has begun. By making adjustments to the
 * stack, we can avoid crash stack data being overwritten by this tool,
 * the Boot ROM, and the bootloader.
 *
 * We are using the method defined for `core_esp8266_app_entry_noextra4k.cpp` to
 * load an alternate `app_entry_redefinable()`. For details on this method, see
 * comments in `core_esp8266_main.cpp's app_entry()`.
 *
 * Using this tool's alternate `app_entry_redefinable()`, we can gain control
 * before the SDK is started. And dump the contents of the "sys" and "cont"
 * stacks.
 *
 * By making some adjustments to start of the stack pointer, at the entry to
 * `app_entry_redefinable()`, and also to the stack pointer passed to the SDK,
 * we can preserve the stack during an HWDT event.
 *
 * To use this tool, select HWDT or HWDT_NOEXTRA4K from the Arduino IDE menu
 * "Tools->Debug Level" before building your sketch. Note, 'Tools->Debug port'
 * selection is not needed or referenced for printing the HWDT stack dump.
 *
 * To enable in other build environments, add DEBUG_ESP_HWDT_NOEXTRA4K or
 * DEBUG_ESP_HWDT global defines to your build.
 *
 * This tool prints to the serial port at the default serial port speed set by
 * the Boot ROM. On a Hardware WDT reset that port speed is 115200 bps. If your
 * needs differ, see the DEBUG_ESP_HWDT_UART_SPEED option below.
 *
 * More on crystal differences and data rates:
 *     When the ESP8266 restarts because of a Hardware WDT reset, the port speed
 *     defaults to 115200. This will be the speed, even if you have a 26MHz or
 *     40MHz Crystal. If you would like to use a different data rate, use the
 *     option DEBUG_ESP_HWDT_UART_SPEED described below.
 *
 *     The Boot ROM initially sets the UART clock divisor to support a data rate
 *     of 115200 bps with the assumption that it has a 40MHz crystal. When a
 *     26MHz crystal is used instead, the resulting error gives us a real rate
 *     of 74880 bps and printing is garbled at first, until the CPU clock's PLL
 *     is adjusted by the NONOS SDK. While CH_PD and EST_RST bring the CPU back
 *     to this state of underclocking with a 26MHz crystal, the Hardware WDT
 *     reset does not appear to do the same. The UART continues to be clocked at
 *     a rate to support a device at 115200 bps. Thus, allowing us to see the
 *     old cryptic WDT message along with our new stack dump.
 *
 *
 * When you get a stack dump, copy-paste it into the "ESP Exception Decoder".
 * Since we don't have an SP, we see a lot more stuff in the report, compared to
 * what you would see with a postmortem report. Start at the bottom and work
 * your way up. At this time, I have not had a lot of practice using this tool.
 * TODO: Update description with more details when available.
 *
 * SYS Stack Issue with Extra 4K Heap option:
 *     During WiFi Connect, Reconnect, and about every hour a block of memory
 *     0x3FFFEA80 - 0x3FFFEB30 (176 bytes) is zeroed by the Boot ROM function
 *     aes_decrypt_init. All other painted memory in the area was untouched
 *     after starting WiFi. See `core/esp8266/aes_unwrap.cpp` for more details.
 *
 *
 * Possible Issues/Thoughts/Improvements:
 *
 * On reboot after an OTA download, eboot requires a lot of stack and DRAM
 * space. On the other hand, for routine loads from flash, the stack and DRAM
 * usage is small, leaving us valid data to print a stack dump.
 *
 * If a problem should arise with some data elements being corrupted during
 * reboot, would it be possible to move their DRAM location higher in memory?
 *
 * Also, DRAM being valid across reset events other than power-on and deep
 * sleep, suggest that a variable in the .noinit section could be used instead
 * of the more limited RTC Memory for sketches that don't do deep sleep.
 * However, DRAM should be considered invalid after an upload serial or OTA.
 * These operations use a lot of DRAM.
 *
 * With this module active, postmortem stack dumps will be a little longer than
 * they need to be. The sys stack now ends at 0x3FFFFC00 instead of 0x3FFFFB0.
 *
 * Maybe an in/out ref count would be nice for bearssl and cont stacks.

/*
 * DEBUG_ESP_HWDT_NOEXTRA4K
 *
 * This option will leave more of the system stack available for the stack dump.
 * A problem we have with the "4K extra" option, is it pushes the system stack
 * up into the ROM's BSS area which gets zeroed at reboot by the Boot ROM.
 *
 * Using this option has the effect of taking 4K of DRAM away from the heap,
 * which gets used for the "cont" stack. Leaving an extra 4K on the "sys" stack,
 * that is clear of the ROM's BSS area. This allows for a more complete "sys"
 * stack dump. The choice here can depend on where you are crashing.
 *
 * Because we don't know where the crash occurs, this option prints two stack
 * dumps, one for "cont" (user stack) and one for "sys" (NONOS SDK).
 *
 * In contrast, if the hang is happening on the "cont" stack, you don't need a
 * complete stack dump of the "sys" stack. You can omit this define and have an
 * extra 4K in the heap.

 * can skip this option and save on the IRAM space. Note this option only

 *
 * Prints a simple introduction to let you know this tool is active and in the

 * above. May not be worth the cost in IRAM.
 *
 * EDIT: There is something different in the UART setup after a flash upload. I
 * am unable to print using the same code that works for Power-on and an EXT_RST
 * at any other time. After the SDK has run a 2nd EXT_RST will show the greeting
 * message.
 *
 * EDIT2: Seems to work better now. Placed delays around calls to
 * uart_div_modify(). Leave these comments until I have more experience with

 *
 * EDIT3: The delay before the uart_div_modify() has been replaced with a wait
 * till FIFO empty loop. I now believe the lost greeting message after an

 * re-engaging. This is not an issue that needs to be addressed here.

/*
 * DEBUG_ESP_HWDT_ROM_STACK_SIZE
 *
 * There are four sections of code starting just before 0x40000000, that share
 * the same stack space.
 *   1) The Boot ROM (uses around 640 bytes)
 *   2) The Bootloader, eboot.elf (uses around 720 bytes.)
 *   3) `app_entry_redefinable()` just before it starts the SDK.
 *   4) The NONOS SDK and optionally the Core when the extra 4K option is selected.
 *
 * To preserve the sketch stack data for a stack dump, I define three separate
 * stacks:
 *   1) Boot ROM and eboot
 *   2) this stack dump code
 *   3) SDK, Core, and Sketch
 *
 * For the "NO extra 4K Heap" case, we use a ROM stack size of 1024. However,
 * without `aes_unwrap.cpp`, 1024 is not safe for the "extra 4K of heap" case.
 * Bad crashes happen with the 1024 and the "extra 4K of Heap". For now, leave
 * this case with 720 bytes for ROM Stack since it also gives more SYS stack for
 * dumping. See comment in aes_unwrap.cpp for AES buffer clash with SYS stack
 * space description.
 *
 * If or when eboot.elf uses more than 720 there will be a little over-writing
 * of the cont stack that we report. Then 720 can be increased as long as the
 * replacement aes_unwrap is used.
 *
 * If possible, use the no-extra 4K heap option. This is the optimum choice for
 * debugging HWDT crashes. It has the content of SYS stack fully exposed.

     * Detecting a Hardware WDT (HWDT) reset is a little complicated at boot
     * before the SDK is started.
     *
     * While the ROM API will report an HWDT, it does not change the status
     * after a software restart. And the SDK has not been started so its API is
     * not available.
     *
     * There is a value in System RTC memory that appears to store, at restart,
     * the reset reason for the SDK. I assume it is set by SDK before the
     * restart. Of course, this value is invalid at power on before the SDK
     * runs. It is set to 0 by the SDK after init and later is changed to a 1
     * and remains 1 during the operation of the sketch. So during normal
     * execution the reason is preset to indicate a Hardware WDT reset.
     *
     * These cases represent some examples. The list is not meant to be
     * comprehensive.
     *
     * Case 1: At power-on boot the ROM API result is valid; however, the SDK
     * value in RTC Memory has not been set at this time.
     *
     * Case 2: A HWDT reset has occurred, which is later followed with a
     * restart by the SDK. At boot, the ROM API result still reports the HWDT
     * reason.
     *
     * Case 3: It is pssible to see a value of 0 or 1 (power-on or HWDT) for the
     * SDK reset reason for both EXT_RST and Hardware WDT resets. For either of
     * these values, the ROM API does hold the valid reset reason.
     *
     * I need to know if this is the 1st boot at power on. Combining these
     * indicators has been tricky, I think I now have it.
     *
     * Maybe a TODO: This logic is for the general case of detecting the true
     * reset cause before the SDK is started. It may be possible to reduce to
     * a specific HWDT test. Leaving for now.
