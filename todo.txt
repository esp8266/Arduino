Improve preprocessing of sketches:
 - Better determine which header files are included (not commented out).
 - Remember the original locations of function prototypes to highlight the correct line on error.
 - [done] Insert prototypes at a better spot in the code (after pre-processor directives).
 - [done] Don't move #include statements.
 - [done] Better determine which functions need prototypes
Update version of the FTDI drivers (Windows).
Move AVR ISP and giveio drivers elsewhere (Windows).
Add #defines for the analog input pins.
Deal with shorter screens (e.g. ASUS EEPC).
[done] Add timeout parameter to pulseIn().
[done] Update version of the FTDI drivers (Mac).
[done] Allow disabling of serial flushing before upload (for the Arduino BT).
[done] Modify parallel port programmer burning (add -F, lower or remove delay).
[done] Allow uploading using a hardware programmer.
[done] Add analogReference() function.
[done] Add miscellaneous #defines (interrupts(), int(), etc.)
[done] Add map() function.
[done] Fix find in reference.
[done] Include stable version of Firmata in hardware/firmwares.

AVR

Add parameter to shiftOut() for specifying a number of bits.
Add parameter to Serial.print[ln](x, BYTE) for specifying number of bits.
Add support for ATmega1280 (e.g. timers, external interrupts, multiple serial ports).
Add weak attribute to signal handlers (http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1203798214)
Incorporate ladyada's new SoftwareSerial library.
Good way to receive multiple values / complex messages over the serial port.
Floating point support in the map() function.
Consider moving millis() to timer 1, and configuring it so the interrupt is generated once a millisecond.
Fix millis() so it overflows on a nice variable-size boundary.
Fix delayMicroseconds(0).
Add sleep function(s).
Add SPI library.
Add pulseOut(), etc. functions from Wiring.
Add String library.
Add LCD library.
Add Servo library.
Create Encoder library (but don't include in the distribution).
Create Ping library (but don't include in the distribution).
Add highByte(), lowByte(), and word(high, low) functions.
Add bitRead() and bitWrite() functions.
Include Arduino as AVR-ISP sketch in hardware/firmwares.

COMPUTER

Multiple sketch windows.
Easier library discovery and installation.
Easier board installation.
Clean up Library and LibraryManager.
Byte-based serial monitor.
Investigate method for auto-detecting serial port on Windows.
Guess serial port on the Mac and Linux.
Automatic detection of baud rate for serial monitor (based on the call to Serial.begin() in the current sketch).
Improve, generally, the upload experience (e.g. faster program start after upload, keep-alive messages to bootloader from IDE, shorter bootloader timeout if possible, progress bar)
Enable drag-and-drop of .pde files to Arduino dock icon.
Allow uploading of .hex files.
Allow for arbitrary compilation command line arguments.
Find in reference should give same message for missing page as for missing page association.
Test find in reference on libraries.

DEVELOPMENT

Include newer version of avr-gcc (one that supports the ATmega1280).
Revise fetch.sh to look for version specific pages (names suffixed with, e.g., "-0007")
If possible, install bug tracking and svn on arduino.cc.
Move to ant for build process (limitations: can't build bootloader, can't build Windows arduino.exe, etc.)

DOCUMENTATION

Get good top-down, well-lit, plain-white-background photos of the Arduino boards.
Electronics reference a la Wiring.
Documentation for moving from Arduino to custom PCBs.
Examples should demonstrate use of functions.
Add examples using specific hardware.
Programming tutorial for Arduino.
Write advanced library tutorial.
Work on opening up website to public editing.
Document optocoupler.
Replace rainbow diagram on the guide to the board page.
Upload photo of single sided Arduino board.
Update pictures to use Arduino Diecimila: Guide/Board, tutorials, 
Create an example for using a simple analog sensor like an LDR, PWM.
Create diagrams and schematics for the examples.
Create community section of site.
Create form for submitting workshops.
Create form for submitting projects.
Create community to do list.

Getting Started:
Consider deleting many of the pictures in the howto's as they just make it harder to see the instructions without adding much (e.g. the pictures of files in folders).
Tell people not to put the board on a Powerbook.
People don't know what a jumper is.
Add picture of the RX/TX LEDs flashing.
Show a picture of the LED flashing.
