X more info in the todo about event handling

_ sonia is locking up on load in rev 91
_   prolly something w/ the threading issues
_ make a note in the library howto about using something besides p5

_ reference: createFont() when not providing the .ttf is strongly discouraged
_   from use in sketches, because users will rarely have the same font
_ don't allow subfolders inside the sketchbook folder
_   once a sketch is found, don't recurse deeper
_   same for libraries, cuz this makes a mess
_   (do this right after rev 91 release... could break things)
_ make simple tool for casey to rebuild all the examples at once
_   just make it easier to go to the next sketch
_   need to rebuild with this release because of 1.3/1.4 issues

PDE / Editor Buttons

_ when holding down shift, show the alternate behavior for EditorHeader
_   http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37
_ run button not properly unhighlighting
_   does it unhighlight after compile or runtime errors?
_   also when using draw() instead of loop()
_     applet needs to notify runner that it has terminated
_   http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=38
_ if export fails (compile error) need to un-highlight the export button
_   http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=39


PDE / Editor Header

_ make some fancy extendo things because the tabs get too big
_   either condense or popdown menu thingy
_ ctrl-tab to switch between tabs
_ not always updating on rename (maybe a mac problem?)


PDE / Editor Status

_ error messages run off the edge and go invisible
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1074894329
_ multiple errors a mess in jikes
_   actual error may be 4th of 5
_   maybe a dropdown list thing, with the first just shown?
_ move to modal dialog showError/Message/Warning/Prompt design 
_   nicely design dialog boxes to go with visual of p5
_   maybe something that shows stack trace?
_   with an 'email this' button? (include source code too?)
_   also need a "prompt" dialog for asking filenames, etc
_   implement and remove PdeEditorStatus stuff


PDE / Export

_ write export-to-application
_   problem with packages.. currently mainClassName is preproc name
_     and "name" is the sketch name, w/o package
_     but if a package were in use, then would be trouble
_   lock feature for present mode (part of export to application?)
_   application can still do serial (qt, other stuff?) 
_   applet runs in browser, though applet on cbagel is everything..
_   include main class info for executable jar file with jdk > 1.2
_   not difficult to do, just some tweaking once applet export works
_   wrapper that invokes the applet using a copy of the jre
_   main() method needs to set layout manager if jexegen is to be used
_     (msft vm defaults to null layout manager)
_   also make sure pack() is happening
_   add manifest.mf to exported applets so that applications will work
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1045983103;start=0
_   BApplet.main(new String[] { "flashcards3" });
_     this will need to detect whether the user has their own main()
_     or even BApplet.main(new String[] { getClass().getName() });
_     META-INF/MANIFEST.MF contains just "Main-Class: ClassName"
_     main sticking point will be serial/qtjava in exports
_ include a note that 'applet' folder will get emptied/rewritten
_   or rename the old applet folder to something else? (nah, too messy)
_ make multiple jar files thing work as an option
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1067360903;start=0
_   applet default is one file, application default is multiple
_   user in advanced mode can switch to the other
_   buttons on side of sketch do default (last) behavior
_ need to decide how to handle "stop" button in present mode
_   when running externally, people need to write their own stop function
_   just get export to application working so this can be supported
_   for now, they're stuck w/ running in the env and getting the ugliness
_ if size() not found in export/compile, ask the user
_   size(myWidth, myHeight) -> set static var in BGraphics
_     for the last size that was used, use as default for fill-in field
_ subfolders in the 'data' directory don't work
_ make export put a timestamp in the html code (hidden or visible)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1075659029


PDE / Find & Replace

_ only enable "find next" in menu after a find has happened
_ several tweaks
_   allowing to find & replace over multiple tabs 
-   placing "replace" next to "find" ... (hitting "replace all" by accident) 
-   have a button "replace & find next"
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Suggestions;action=display;num=1115645270;start=0
_ fix find/replace focus issue on osx
_   give that field focus explicitly, rather than just for typing
_   right now, typing works, but no caret, no blue highlight
_   and on second find run, should instead select all the find string
_     so that typing will replace it directly
_ all around very ugly, fix it up


PDE / History

_ implement new version of history
_   make history folder, and a zip (not gz) file for each entry
_   history causing trouble - super slow with a huge sketch
_     could instead be gzipped and appended to history.dat
_     along with another file that is actually a table of offsets
_     no need to make the thing a gzip stream
_     checkbox on menu for 'record history' ?
_     history converter option?
_   only first 20 entries visible?
_   zlib file becoming corrupt (not flushed after close?)
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1080346981;start=0
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1088333655;start=0
_   shortcut to walk through history, ala photoshop (ctrl-alt-z)


PDE / Preferences

_ saved window positions.. if displays has changed, becomes a problem
_   record the display that it was on?
_     GraphicsDevice gd = frame.getGraphicsConfiguration().getDevice();
_   make sure that the applet is within the bounds of the current display?
_   (from 0, 0 to width, height)
_ make note that changing screen config requires restart of processing
_   static { checkScreens(); }
_   static void PApplet.checkScreens() { } 
_   to run explicitly later
_   this seems too complicated.. just make people restart
_ split Preferences and PreferencesFrame ?
_ preferences window has been hit with the ugly stick
_   redo panel to use proper swing layout etc
_   also needs to look good across all platforms
_ make available the background colors for present mode, stop button color


PDE / Runner 

_ stop() not working very well
_   doesn't seem to actually be stopping things
_ closing window w/o first hitting stop() causes freak out
_   opengl gives an OutOfMemoryError
_   java2d just goes into a lock
_   could also be code that's in an infinite loop (i.e. text error) 
_     which then causes a full lock
_ something really bad happened with println() in this release
_   perhaps only without a code folder and/or running in java2d mode?
_   this may also be what's hosing 
_ external apps don't stop at all when 'stop' is hit
_   worker thread is halting the app ala code folder bug
_   could this be dealt with by using nio? 
_     host environment will be running 1.4 so...
_ npe is a runtimeex, so any npe in setup comes up weird
_   maybe the renderer exception is something different? newrendex?
_ if in full java mode
_   if extends PApplet.. or rather, put PApplet cast into a 
_   try/catch block.. if it doesn't work, try applet. if that
_   doesn't work, try using the class' main() to run it
_ exception in setup() on external app doesn't kill run button 
_   also doesn't kill external vm
_ quitting from present mode doesn't kill run button
_ exceptions in draw() apps aren't caught
_   the program resize(200, 200); just does nothing (doesn't complain)
_ weird exception in the run button watcher
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=42
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1115936913;start=0


PDE / Sketch & Sketchbook

_ transparently convert spaces to underscores (?)
_   underscoring everything is kinda nasty
_ if a .pde isn't contained in a properly named folder
_   offer to rename the parent folder, rather than placing in a new folder
_ may need a progress bar for "save as"
_   or just the file copy function in general
_   since it may take a long time (i.e. 1000s of screen grabs)
_ "save as" shouldn't show save as dialog for sketches 
_   unless that's the current mode that's being used
_ scanning sketchbook folder may be extremely slow 
_   not sure why this would be the case
_ handle renaming with case changes (currently ignores case change)
_   see notes/bitching in Sketch.nameCode()
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1116171607;start=0
_ "save as" loses cursor/scroll positions (because reloading)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Suggestions;action=display;num=1115486342;start=0
_ setting sketchbook to a folder on the network
_   does this work? test on both on mac and pc.. 
_   or if not, should recommend people against it 
_   (i.e. folders disappearing if net has trouble)
_ some type of sketch archive format for posting examples (.psk?)
_   would be nice to open a sketch directly from a zip file

TOOLS / General
_ how to handle command keys
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Suggestions;action=display;num=1114885272;start=0
_ make dynamically loaded plugins and "tools" menu
_   break out beautify as its own plugin
_ color picker or other things written by folks
_   add all .jar files in lib/plugins on startup
_ make some kind of internal color picker
_   could be a separate window that's always around if needed
_ external editor -> add a command to launch
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1043734580;start=0
_ add tool to hit 'next' to go through examples
_   just make it "next file in folder" since examples are all over
_   also need to copy examples locally
_ add tool for running in jview
_   only available after export (or when an applet dir exists)
_   warn user that applet html will be over-written
_ add tool to "Add custom html to sketch"
_   that copies applet.html, 
_   opens sketch folder, 
_   and gives info about what to do next (how to edit)
_ run in appletviewer? sun.applet.Main is appletviewer


TOOLS / Auto Format

_ if an error occurs during format, report it and don't change text
_ do a better job of maintaining cursor during beautify 
_ only auto format a particular section of code
_   set the 'tabs' var based on how many spaces on previous line
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1087227217
_ bugs in auto-format
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1117081646


TOOLS / Create Font

_ create the tool object on startup, then use thread to getAllFonts()
_ close/hide window on 'ESC'
_ loading is very slow on the first time (getting all font names)
_   show a progress/status bar while it's happening?
_   (would be useful to at least tell user that system not locked up)
_ create font with user-specified charsets

_   sketch .zip file in casey's email message
_ video wrong device name crashes things
_ when passing in 'null' as the capture, dialog pops up fine
_   but the applet craps out after a few seconds (pinwheel spin)
_ couldn't get req'd component also happens when the capture isn't ready
_   may also mean that no camera is plugged in
_   also, don't mention winvdig on the mac
_ if user cancels prompt, throws a '-128,userCanceledErr'
_   in which case, need to return null (or ""?) for the prompt
_   which will also just give you the last camera
_   should it be new Camera(PROMPT);
_ saveFrame() directly to quicktime via port of DbnRecorder
_   do this after beta, not likely to work with java 1.4 on macosx


LIBRARIES / Net

_ move the useful serial buffering fxns into net library
_ make the Client list public
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1116056805;start=0


LIBRARIES / Serial

_ port buffering not working properly
_   may just be a problem with thread starvation
_   bufferUntil() fires an event but continues to fill up the buffer
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1116797335;start=0#0
_ add prompt() method to Serial (simple dialog box that pops up)

DIST

How the environment gets packed up, downloaded, and installed.


DIST / General 

_ move build scripts to something better like ant
_   too much to maintain the multiple versions, too much code
_ update things for java 1.5 since it's inevitable
_ need .pde document icons
_ need .psk file icon
_ need exported application icons
_ also out of cvs
_   check for necessary tools to be installed
_   zip, unzip, jikes, etc
_ need more comprehensive list of 'known bugs'
_ need more comprehensive list of 'known suggestions'
_ javadoc "advanced" reference by beta
_   and then finalizing it towards 1.0
_   document hint() commands for advanced reference
_ write notes about running p5 on another platforms 
_   this was some feedback from running on bsd:
_     /usr/local/jdk1.3.1/bin/java -cp lib:lib/build:lib/pde.jar:lib/kjc.jar:lib/oro.jar:java/lib/ext/comm.jar PdeBase 
_   need to use the 1.3 vm, and get a fake platform name
_   otherwise, goes looking for lib/pde_.properties or something
o modify antlr stuff to conditionally recompile in make.sh
_   compile antlr inside the initial setup of the work dir
X     done for macosx
_     fix this for windows and linux
_ about box 
_   bring up information about gpl, lgpl, and ibmpl
_   jedit syntax is under mit license
_     http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php
_ different name for 'lib' folder because of libraries folder?
_   avoid some confusion for when describing the libraries folder to users
_ remove jvm from cvs
_   use wget to grab it if it doesn't exist
_   and include an md5hash to see if the file is correct


DIST / Windows

_ tie .pde files as documents of the application
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1094149466
_   figure out proper registry key for windows
_     can be handled when the app first run (jni?)
_   write handler for main() to take document names
_ properly handle non-ascii chars in p5 folder name
_   or at least warn the user to install somehwere else
_ track down the cause of the processing.exe not starting bugs
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1062794781
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1067764732
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1094148057
_ winamp/audio getting starved or crackly while applets running
_   thread priority too high? or something weird
_ need splash screen, startup takes a long time
_ processing.exe: problem if expert version is run, and no java installed
_   call the person a genius and tell them to install java
_ p5's exe has trouble when PATH has quotes (or spaces?)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1068388889
_   CLASSPATH figured out what to do with quotes, but not PATH
_ NullPointerException when alt is pressed
_   (not our bug, but log it in the bug db anyways)
_   might be something to do with the applet frame being an awt not swing
_   event first goes to the applet listener, needs to consume the event

DIST / Mac OS X

_ set nice background for disk image on macosx
_ test more to see if runtime exceptions are coming through
_ track down error in PdeCompiler for message parsing
_   was missing the error about a package being gone
_   can comment out /System/Library/ as a test
_ Contents/Resources/Java can take jnilib files
_ set file type/creator for .pde files of examples
_ would be nice to have macosx packaged up as a single .app file
_ is there a way to set the color of the Frame growbox?
_   currently it's white instead of dark gray like the ui
_   setBackground(Color) didn't seem to help inside PdeBase.<init>
_ use disk:// notation as panther alternative
_   so that it doesn't download the disk, just mounts it
_   although.. this only works on panther.. how many are using it?
_ mac standard key combinations for moving around in the editor
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1093116515


DIST / Linux

_ computationally intensive stuff runs really slow inside p5
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1116872745;start=0#3
_ some reports of it not quitting properly, but not confirmed
_ splash screen
