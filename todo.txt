COMPUTER

Check RAM usage of sketches: http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1224729260/0#0

 - Remember the original locations of function prototypes to highlight the correct line on error.
Multiple sketch windows.
Easier library discovery and installation.
Easier board installation ("Add board..." menu item)
Comprehensive board management:
 - Enabled and disabled boards.
 - Dialog for enabling, disabling, adding, and deleting boards.
 - Board descriptions (e.g. explaining differences between boards).
Allow for libraries in <SKETCHBOOK>/libraries.
Clean up Library and LibraryManager.
Detect dependencies between libraries.
Byte-based serial monitor.
Line termination options in the serial monitor.
Clear character should clear serial monitor.

Include newer version of avr-gcc (one that supports the ATmega1280).
Revise fetch.sh to look for version specific pages (names suffixed with, e.g., "-0007")
If possible, install bug tracking and svn on arduino.cc.
Move to ant for build process.
