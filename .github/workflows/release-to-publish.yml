# Whenever a release is published from a draft, this will update the
# master Arduino JSON file to add its new entry.

# We keep the master JSON file in another repo, so we need to use a pre-set GH
# SSH key to be able to push a change to the repo.

# At some point this should really be moved to the main repo to avoid this grief

#### Steps to follow when you need to make a new SSH key for upload (not
#### normally needed!)

# We encrypt the id_rda (private key) using a key and IV generated randomly:
# openssl enc -nosalt -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -k "$(openssl rand -base64 100 | sed s/=//)" -P
# > key = <long string of hex>
# > iv  = <long string of hex>

# Set that key and IV strings are set as secrets in the *Arduino repo* GitHub
# CI Secrets object as GHKEY and GHIV.

# Now make a SSH key using ssh-keygen (do not use your own, make a new one!)
# ssh-keygen ...

# Upload the id_rsa.pub (public key) to the GH.IO GitHub as a *deploy key*
# (https://github.com/esp8266/esp8266.github.io->Settings->Deploy Keys->Add Key)
# DO NOT USE Settings->SSH and GPG Keys->New SSH Key because that allows
# full access to all repos owned by the user, while a Deploy Key only allows
# access to a single repo.

# Encrypt the private part of the key using the key and IV above and commit the change
# openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -K <key> -iv <iv> -in id_rsa -out package/esp8266_github_io_deploy.enc
# git add package/esp8266_github_io_deploy.enc
