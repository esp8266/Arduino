/**
 * Storage class for user preferences and environment settings.
 * <p/>
 * This class no longer uses the Properties class, since
 * properties files are iso8859-1, which is highly likely to
 * be a problem when trying to save sketch folders and locations.
 * <p/>
 * The GUI portion in here is really ugly, as it uses exact layout. This was
 * done in frustration one evening (and pre-Swing), but that's long since past,
 * and it should all be moved to a proper swing layout like BoxLayout.
 * <p/>
 * This is very poorly put together, that the preferences panel and the actual
 * preferences i/o is part of the same code. But there hasn't yet been a
 * compelling reason to bother with the separation aside from concern about
 * being lectured by strangers who feel that it doesn't look like what they
 * learned in CS class.
 * <p/>
 * Would also be possible to change this to use the Java Preferences API.
 * Some useful articles
 * <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/synd/2001/10/17/j2se.html">here</a> and
 * <a href="http://www.particle.kth.se/~lindsey/JavaCourse/Book/Part1/Java/Chapter10/Preferences.html">here</a>.
 * However, haven't implemented this yet for lack of time, but more
 * importantly, because it would entail writing to the registry (on Windows),
 * or an obscure file location (on Mac OS X) and make it far more difficult to
 * find the preferences to tweak them by hand (no! stay out of regedit!)
 * or to reset the preferences by simply deleting the preferences.txt file.
