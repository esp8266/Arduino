  Software serial multple serial test

 Receives from the two software serial ports,
 sends to the hardware serial port.

 In order to listen on a software port, you call port.listen().
 When using two software serial ports, you have to switch ports
 by listen()ing on each one in turn. Pick a logical time to switch
 ports, like the end of an expected transmission, or when the
 buffer is empty. This example switches ports when there is nothing
 more to read from a port

 The circuit:
 Two devices which communicate serially are needed.
 * First serial device's TX attached to digital pin 2, RX to pin 3
 * Second serial device's TX attached to digital pin 4, RX to pin 5

 Note:
 Not all pins on the Mega and Mega 2560 support change interrupts,
 so only the following can be used for RX:
 10, 11, 12, 13, 50, 51, 52, 53, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69

 Not all pins on the Leonardo support change interrupts,
 so only the following can be used for RX:
 8, 9, 10, 11, 14 (MISO), 15 (SCK), 16 (MOSI).

  // while there is data coming in, read it
  // and send to the hardware serial port:

    Serial.write(inByte);

  // blank line to separate data from the two ports:
  Serial.println();

  portTwo.listen();
