/*
  Basic Ticker usage

  Ticker is an object that will call a given function with a certain period.
  Each Ticker calls one function. You can have as many Tickers as you like,
  memory being the only limitation.

  A function may be attached to a ticker and detached from the ticker.
  There are two variants of the attach function: attach and attach_ms.
  The first one takes period in seconds, the second one in milliseconds.

  The built-in LED will be blinking.

  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, !state);     // set pin to the opposite state

  ++count;
  // when the counter reaches a certain value, start blinking like crazy
  if (count == 20) {
    flipper.attach(0.1, flip);
  }
  // when the counter reaches yet another value, stop blinking
  else if (count == 120) {
