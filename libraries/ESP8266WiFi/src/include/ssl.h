/**
 * @mainpage axTLS API
 *
 * @image html axolotl.jpg
 *
 * The axTLS library has features such as:
 * - The TLSv1 SSL client/server protocol
 * - No requirement to use any openssl libraries.
 * - A choice between AES block (128/256 bit) and RC4 (128 bit) stream ciphers.
 * - RSA encryption/decryption with variable sized keys (up to 4096 bits).
 * - Certificate chaining and peer authentication.
 * - Session resumption, session renegotiation.
 * - ASN.1, X.509, PKCS#8, PKCS#12 keys/certificates with DER/PEM encoding.
 * - Highly configurable compile time options.
 * - Portable across many platforms (written in ANSI C), and has language
 * bindings in C, C#, VB.NET, Java, Perl and Lua.
 * - Partial openssl API compatibility (via a wrapper).
 * - A very small footprint (around 50-60kB for the library in 'server-only'
 *   mode).
 * - No dependencies on sockets - can use serial connections for example.
 * - A very simple API - ~ 20 functions/methods.
 *
 * A list of these functions/methods are described below.
