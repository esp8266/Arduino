// lwIP-v2 backlog facility allows to keep memory safe by limiting the
// maximum number of simultaneously accepted clients.  Default number of
// possibly simultaneously accepted client is defined below, user can
// overide it at runtime from sketch:
//      WiFiServer::begin(port, max-simultaneous-clients-per-port);
// New incoming clients to this server will be delayed until an already
// connected one leaves.
// By "delayed", it is meant that WiFiServer will not answer to the SYN
// packet until there is room for a new one: The server (tcp on that port)
// will be invisible.  When a connected client leaves, the server will
// accept a newcomer at the moment when one of them retries to connect by
// sending another SYN (which will not immediately happen), and before it
// times-out trying to connect.
//
// Back to Arduino scenario:
//
// Usually only one client is used at a time: The client (like a http
// browser) is accepted, served then closed.  The ESP8266WebServer cannot
// answer to another client during that time even if it is tcp-accepted
// (syn-acked), until the current one has been served.
//
// Now that backlog is enabled, at most
// MAX_DEFAULT_SIMULTANEOUS_CLIENTS_PER_PORT clients will be tcp-accepted by
// a WiFiServer even if it is currently busy serving one client (ie: busy
// and not checking WiFiServer::available()/hasClient()).  But next clients
// will be kept out and will have to tcp-retry (as if they were trying to
// connect through a mute firewall):
// - Then eventually one of the connected clients leaves
// - Then a while *after* that moment a waiting/potential client say hello
//   if it has not given up waiting (72 seconds on windows for the connect
//   timeout).
//
// Note that ESPAsync servers may serve more than one client at a time so
// the default setting is not 1 or 2.  It was 0xff by default.  It can be
// overriden at runtime in WiFiServer::begin().
