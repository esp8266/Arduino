/*
 Receive Voice Call

 This sketch, for the Arduino GSM shield, receives voice calls,
 displays the calling number, waits a few seconds then hangs up.

 Circuit:
 * GSM shield
 * Voice circuit. Refer to to the GSM shield getting started guide
   at http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoGSMShield#toc11
 * SIM card that can accept voice calls

 With no voice circuit the call will connect, but will not send or receive sound
