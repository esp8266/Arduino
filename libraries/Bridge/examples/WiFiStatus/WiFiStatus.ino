/*
  WiFi Status

 This sketch runs a script called "pretty-wifi-info.lua"
 installed on your Yún in folder /usr/bin.
 It prints information about the status of your wifi connection.

 It uses Serial to print, so you need to connect your Yún to your
 computer using a USB cable and select the appropriate port from
 the Port menu
