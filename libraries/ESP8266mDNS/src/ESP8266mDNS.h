/*
    ESP8266mDNS.h - mDNSResponder for ESP8266 family
    This file is part of the esp8266 core for Arduino environment.

    mDNS implementation, that supports many mDNS features like:
    - Presenting a DNS-SD service to interested observers, eg. a http server by presenting
   _http._tcp service
    - Support for multi-level compressed names in input; in output only a very simple one-leven
   full-name compression is implemented
    - Probing host and service domains for uniqueness in the local network
    - Tiebreaking while probing is supported in a very minimalistic way (the 'higher' IP address
   wins the tiebreak)
    - Announcing available services after successful probing
    - Using fixed service TXT items or
    - Using dynamic service TXT items for presented services (via callback)
    - Remove services (and un-announcing them to the observers by sending goodbye-messages)
    - Static queries for DNS-SD services (creating a fixed answer set after a certain timeout
   period)
    - Dynamic queries for DNS-SD services with cached and updated answers and user notifications
    - Support for multi-homed client host domains

    See 'src/LEAmDNS.h' for implementation details, configuration and usage information.
    See 'examples/LEAmDNS/' for examples of the new features.

    LEAmDNS is expected to be compatible with the original ESP8266mDNS implementation, and it can be
    used as a drop-in replacement in existing projects.
