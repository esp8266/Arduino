ESP8266 Multicast DNS
=====================

A port of CC3000 Multicast DNS library (version 1.1)

This is a simple implementation of multicast DNS query support for an
Arduino running on ESP8266 chip. Only support for resolving address
queries is currently implemented.

Requirements
------------

-  ESP8266WiFi library
-  MDNS support in your operating system/client machines:
-  For Mac OSX support is built in through Bonjour already.
-  For Linux, install `Avahi <http://avahi.org/>`__.
-  For Windows, install
   `Bonjour <http://www.apple.com/support/bonjour/>`__.

Usage
-----

1. Download this repository as a zip (button on the right) and follow
   `these instructions to install into
   Arduino <http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries>`__.
2. Include the ESP8266mDNS library in the sketch.
3. Call MDNS.begin method in the sketch's setup and provide a domain
   name (without the '.local' suffix, i.e. just provide 'foo' to resolve
   'foo.local'). Optionally provide the IP address to advertise and time
   to live (in seconds) for the DNS record -- the default is 1 hour.
4. To advertise DNS-SD services, call MDNS.addService(service, proto,
   port), where service and proto are strings with service and protocol
   name (e.g. "http", "tcp"), and port is an integer port number for
   this service (e.g. 80).

See the included MDNS + HTTP server sketch for a full example.
