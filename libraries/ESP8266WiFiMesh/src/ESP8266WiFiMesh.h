  /**
   * WiFiMesh Constructor method. Creates a WiFi Mesh Node, ready to be initialised.
   *
   * @param requestHandler The callback handler for dealing with received requests. Takes a string as an argument which
   *          is the request string received from another node and returns the string to send back.
   * @param responseHandler The callback handler for dealing with received responses. Takes a string as an argument which
   *          is the response string received from another node. Returns a transmission status code as a transmission_status_t.
   * @param networkFilter The callback handler for deciding which WiFi networks to connect to.
   * @param mesh_password The WiFi password for the mesh network.
   * @param mesh_name The name of the mesh network. Used as prefix for the node SSID and to find other network nodes in the example network filter function.
   * @param node_id The id for this mesh node. Used as suffix for the node SSID. If set to "", the id will default to ESP.getChipId().
   * @param verbose_mode Determines if we should print the events occurring in the library to Serial. Off by default.
   * @param mesh_wifi_channel The WiFi channel used by the mesh network. Valid values are integers from 1 to 13. Defaults to 1.
   *                    WARNING: The ESP8266 has only one WiFi channel, and the the station/client mode is always prioritized for channel selection.
   *                    This can cause problems if several ESP8266WiFiMesh instances exist on the same ESP8266 and use different WiFi channels. 
   *                    In such a case, whenever the station of one ESP8266WiFiMesh instance connects to an AP, it will silently force the 
   *                    WiFi channel of any active AP on the ESP8266 to match that of the station. This will cause disconnects and possibly 
   *                    make it impossible for other stations to detect the APs whose WiFi channels have changed.
   * @param server_port The server port used by the AP of the ESP8266WiFiMesh instance. If multiple APs exist on a single ESP8266, each requires a separate server port. 
   *              If two AP:s on the same ESP8266 are using the same server port, you must call deactivateAP on the active AP before calling activateAP on the inactive AP.
