   * There is a constant-time HMAC version available. More constant-time info here: https://www.bearssl.org/constanttime.html
   * For small messages, it takes substantially longer time to complete than a normal HMAC (5 ms vs 2 ms in a quick benchmark, 
   * determined by the difference between min and max allowed message length), and it also sets a maximum length that messages can be (1024 bytes by default).
   * Making the fixed max length variable would defeat the whole purpose of using constant-time, and not making it variable would create the wrong HMAC if message size exceeds the maximum.
   * 
   * Also, HMAC is already partially constant-time. Quoting the link above: 
   * "Hash functions implemented by BearSSL (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512) consist in bitwise logical operations and additions on 32-bit or 64-bit words, 
   * naturally yielding constant-time operations. HMAC is naturally as constant-time as the underlying hash function. The size of the MACed data, and the size of the key, 
   * may leak, though; only the contents are protected."
   * 
   * Thus the non constant-time version is used within the mesh framework instead.
