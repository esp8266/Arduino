// ESP-NOW is faster for small data payloads (up to a few kB, split over multiple messages). Transfer of up to 234 bytes takes 4 ms.
// In general ESP-NOW transfer time can be approximated with the following function: transferTime = ceil(bytesToTransfer / 234.0)*3 ms.
// If you only transfer 234 bytes at a time, this adds up to around 56kB/s. Finally a chance to relive the glory of the olden days
// when people were restricted to V90 dial-up modems for internet access!
// TCP-IP takes longer to connect (around 1000 ms), and an AP has to disconnect all connected stations in order to transfer data to another AP, 
// but this backend has a much higher data transfer speed than ESP-NOW once connected (100x faster or so).

  /**
   * TCP/IP constructor method. Creates a TCP/IP node, ready to be initialised.
   *
   * @param requestHandler The callback handler for dealing with received requests. Takes a string as an argument which
   *          is the request string received from another node and returns the string to send back.
   * @param responseHandler The callback handler for dealing with received responses. Takes a string as an argument which
   *          is the response string received from another node. Returns a transmission status code as a TransmissionStatusType.
   * @param networkFilter The callback handler for deciding which WiFi networks to connect to.
   * @param meshPassword The WiFi password for the mesh network.
   * @param ssidPrefix The prefix (first part) of the node SSID.
   * @param ssidSuffix The suffix (last part) of the node SSID.
   * @param verboseMode Determines if we should print the events occurring in the library to Serial. Off by default. This setting is separate for each TcpIpMeshBackend instance.
   * @param meshWiFiChannel The WiFi channel used by the mesh network. Valid values are integers from 1 to 13. Defaults to 1.
   *                    WARNING: The ESP8266 has only one WiFi channel, and the station/client mode is always prioritized for channel selection.
   *                    This can cause problems if several mesh instances exist on the same ESP8266 and use different WiFi channels. 
   *                    In such a case, whenever the station of one mesh instance connects to an AP, it will silently force the 
   *                    WiFi channel of any active AP on the ESP8266 to match that of the station. This will cause disconnects and possibly 
   *                    make it impossible for other stations to detect the APs whose WiFi channels have changed.
   * @param serverPort The server port used both by the AP of the TcpIpMeshBackend instance and when the instance connects to other APs. 
   *                   If multiple APs exist on a single ESP8266, each requires a separate server port. 
   *                   If two AP:s on the same ESP8266 are using the same server port, they will not be able to have both server instances active at the same time.                  
   *                   This is managed automatically by the activateAP method.
