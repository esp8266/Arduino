/**
   This example makes every node broadcast their AP MAC to the rest of the network during the first 28 seconds, as long as the node thinks it has the highest AP MAC in the network.
   Once 28 seconds have passed, the node that has the highest AP MAC will start broadcasting benchmark messages, which will allow you to see how many messages are lost at the other nodes.
   If you have an onboard LED on your ESP8266 it is recommended that you change the useLED variable below to true.
   That way you will get instant confirmation of the mesh communication without checking the Serial Monitor.

   If you want to experiment with reducing error rates you can use the mesh method "void setBroadcastReceptionRedundancy(uint8_t redundancy);" (default 2) at the cost of more RAM.
   Or "floodingMesh.getEspnowMeshBackend().setBroadcastTransmissionRedundancy(uint8_t redundancy)" (default 1) at the cost of longer transmission times.
