/*
  Repeating Web client

 This sketch connects to a a web server and makes a request
 using a Wiznet Ethernet shield. You can use the Arduino Ethernet shield, or
 the Adafruit Ethernet shield, either one will work, as long as it's got
 a Wiznet Ethernet module on board.

 This example uses DNS, by assigning the Ethernet client with a MAC address,
 IP address, and DNS address.

 Circuit:
 * Ethernet shield attached to pins 10, 11, 12, 13

// fill in an available IP address on your network here,
// for manual configuration:
IPAddress ip(10, 0, 0, 20);

// fill in your Domain Name Server address here:

// the "L" is needed to use long type numbers

  // start serial port:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // give the ethernet module time to boot up:

  // start the Ethernet connection using a fixed IP address and DNS server:

  }

  // if there's no net connection, but there was one last time
  // through the loop, then stop the client:

    Serial.println("disconnecting.");
    client.stop();

  // if there's a successful connection:
  if (client.connect(server, 80)) {
