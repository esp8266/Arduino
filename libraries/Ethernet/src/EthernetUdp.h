/*
 *  Udp.cpp: Library to send/receive UDP packets with the Arduino ethernet shield.
 *  This version only offers minimal wrapping of socket.c/socket.h
 *  Drop Udp.h/.cpp into the Ethernet library directory at hardware/libraries/Ethernet/ 
 *
 * NOTE: UDP is fast, but has some important limitations (thanks to Warren Gray for mentioning these)
 * 1) UDP does not guarantee the order in which assembled UDP packets are received. This
 * might not happen often in practice, but in larger network topologies, a UDP
 * packet can be received out of sequence. 
 * 2) UDP does not guard against lost packets - so packets *can* disappear without the sender being
 * aware of it. Again, this may not be a concern in practice on small local networks.
 * For more information, see http://www.cafeaulait.org/course/week12/35.html
