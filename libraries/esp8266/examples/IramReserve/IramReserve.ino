/*
  Overview: Of the 48KB of IRAM, the remaining IRAM after your code is untouched
  during the reboot process. For a sketch that does not use deep-sleep, it is
  possible to pass/hold information across boot cycles in this area of IRAM.

  With the selection of Arduino IDE Tools Option: 'MMU: 16KB cache + 48KB IRAM
  and 2nd Heap (shared)' all of this space goes into a managed 2nd Heap.
  Managed, in this case, refers to using malloc, free, realloc, etc. API.

  The objective of this example is to show how to modify the 2nd Heap creation
  to omit a block of IRAM at the end of the 2nd Heap. In this example, we use
  this block to store a boot count.
