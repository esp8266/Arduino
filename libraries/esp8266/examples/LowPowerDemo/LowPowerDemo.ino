/* This example demonstrates the different low-power modes of the ESP8266

   The initial setup was a WeMos D1 Mini with 3.3V connected to the 3V3 pin through a meter
   so that it bypassed the on-board voltage regulator and USB chip.  There's still about
   0.3 mA worth of leakage current due to the unpowered chips.  These tests should work with
   any module, although on-board components will affect the actual current measurement.
   While the modem is turned on the current is > 67 mA or jumping around with a minimum value.
   To verify the 20 uA Deep Sleep current the voltage regulator and USB chip were removed.

   This test series requires an active WiFi connection to illustrate two tests.  If you
   have problems with WiFi, uncomment the #ifdef DEBUG for additional WiFi error messages.
   The test requires a pushbutton switch connected between D3 and GND to advance the tests.
   You'll also need to connect D0/GPIO16 to RST for the Deep Sleep tests.  If you forget to
   connect D0 to RST it will hang after the first Deep Sleep test.  Additionally, you can
   connect an LED from any free pin through a 1K ohm resistor to the 3.3V supply, though
   preferably not the 3V3 pin on the module or it adds to the measured current.  When the
   LED blinks you can proceed to the next test.  When the LED is lit continuously it's
   connecting WiFi, and when it's off the CPU is asleep.  The LED blinks slowly when the
   tests are complete.  Test progress is also shown on the serial monitor.

   WiFi connections will be made over twice as fast if you can use a static IP address.
