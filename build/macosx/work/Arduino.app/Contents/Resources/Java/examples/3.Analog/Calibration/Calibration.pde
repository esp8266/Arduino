/*
  Calibration
 
 Demonstrates one technique for calibrating sensor input.  The
 sensor readings during the first five seconds of the sketch
 execution define the minimum and maximum of expected values
 attached to the sensor pin.
 
 The sensor minimum and maximum initial values may seem backwards.
 Initially, you set the minimum high and listen for anything 
 lower, saving it as the new minimum. Likewise, you set the
 maximum low and listen for anything higher as the new maximum.
 
 The circuit:
 * Analog sensor (potentiometer will do) attached to analog input 0
 * LED attached from digital pin 9 to ground
