# !!!!!!!! UNLIKE PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF PROCESSING !!!!!!!!!!
# DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE, OR DELETE SETTINGS FROM THIS FILE

# These are the default preferences. If you want to modify 
# them directly, use the per-user local version of the file:

# Documents and Settings -> [username] -> Application Data -> 
#    Processing -> preferences.txt (on Windows XP)

# Users -> [username] -> AppData -> Roaming -> 
#    Processing -> preferences.txt (on Windows Vista)

# ~/Library -> Processing -> preferences.txt (on Mac OS X)

# ~/.processing -> preferences.txt (on Linux)

# The exact location of your preferences file can be found at
# the bottom of the Preferences window inside Processing.

# Because AppData and Application Data may be considered 
# hidden or system folders on Windows, you'll have to ensure
# that they're visible in order to get at preferences.txt

# You'll have problems running Processing if you incorrectly 
# modify lines in this file.

# DEFAULT PATHS FOR SKETCHBOOK AND SETTINGS

# relative paths will be relative to processing.exe or procesing.app.
# absolute paths may also be used.

# note that this path should use forward slashes (like unix)
# instead of \ on windows or : on macos or whatever else

# If you don't want users to have their sketchbook default to 
# "My Documents/Processing" on Windows and "Documents/Processing" on OS X, 
# set this to another path that will be used by default. 
# Note that this path must exist already otherwise it won't see
# the sketchbook folder, and will instead assume the sketchbook
# has gone missing, and that it should instead use the default.
#sketchbook.path=

# if you don't want settings to go into "application data" on windows
# and "library" on macosx, set this to the alternate location.
#settings.path=data

# temporary build path, normally this goes into the default
# "temp" folder for that platform (as defined by java)
# but this can be used to set a specific file in case of problems
