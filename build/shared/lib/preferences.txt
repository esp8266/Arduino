# DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE, OR DELETE SETTINGS FROM THIS FILE

# These are the default preferences. If you want to modify 
# them directly, use the per-user local version of the file:

# Documents and Settings -> Application Data -> 
#    Arduino -> preferences.txt (on windows)

# ~/Library -> Arduino -> preferences.txt (on macosx)

# ~/.processing -> preferences.txt (on linux)

# You'll have problems running Arduino if you incorrectly 
# modify lines in this file.


# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# Some colors have been hardcoded into the source in app/ in order to ensure
# consistency with the images distributed and stored with the application.
# They have been commented out below so that users who install an old
# version of the software will not get incorrect colors left-over from this
# config file.

# DEFAULT PATHS FOR SKETCHBOOK AND SETTINGS

# relative paths will be relative to processing.exe or procesing.app.
# absolute paths may also be used.

# note that this path should use forward slashes (like unix)
# instead of \ on windows or : on macos or whatever else

# the .fallback locations are used in case the default location 
# cannot be written (and the line above it is not customized)

# if you don't want users to have their sketchbook default to 
# "my documents/processing" on windows and "documents/processing" on osx, 
# set this to another path that will be used by default
#sketchbook.path=sketchbook
sketchbook.path.fallback=sketchbook

# if you don't want settings to go into "application data" on windows
# and "library" on macosx, set this to the alternate location.
