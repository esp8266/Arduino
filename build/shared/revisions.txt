ARDUINO 1.0 - 2011.11.30

[environment]

* The file extension for sketches has changed from .pde to .ino, to avoid
  conflicts with the Processing software ("ino" are the last three letters
  in "Arduino").

* There are a new set of toolbar icons, including a checkmark icon to
  verify (compile) a sketch and an arrow for upload. The serial monitor
  icon has moved to the right of the toolbar. Also, shift-clicking the
  upload icon now uploads using a programmer (selected in the Tools menu).
  You can still enable verbose output in the preferences dialog. (Icons
  were designed by Nicholas Zambetti.)

* There’s a new color scheme and about image for the IDE (by ToDo.to.it).

* The name of the currently selected board and serial port are now shown
  at the bottom of the editor. (Code from Wiring.)

* A progress bar is displayed during compilation and upload. (from Wiring.)

[core / libraries]

* Serial transmission is now asynchronous - that is, calls to
  Serial.print(), etc. add data to an outgoing buffer which is transmitted
  in the background. Also, the Serial.flush() command has been repurposed
  to wait for outgoing data to be transmitted, rather than dropping
  received incoming data.

* The behavior of Serial.print() on a byte has been changed to align it
  with the other numeric data types. In particular, it will now print
  the digits of its argument as separate ASCII digits (e.g. '1', '2', '3')
  rather than a single byte. The BYTE keyword has been removed. To send a
  single byte of data, use Serial.write() (which is present in Arduino 0022
  as well).

* The Serial class (as well as other classes inheriting from Stream, like
  EthernetClient, SoftwareSerial, Wire and more) now contains functions
  for parsing incoming data, based on the TextFinder library by Michael
  Margolis. They include find() and findUntil() to search for data,
  parseInt() and parseFloat() for converting incoming characters into
  numeric values, and readBytes() and readBytesUntil() for reading
  multiple bytes into a buffer. They use a timeout that can be set with the
  new setTimeout().

* The SoftwareSerial class has been reimplemented, using the code originally
  written for the NewSoftSerial library by Mikal Hart. This allows for
  multiple simultaneous instances, although only one can receive at a time.

* Support has been added for printing strings stored in flash (program
  memory) rather than RAM. Wrap double-quoted strings in F() to indicate
  that they should be stored in flash, e.g. Serial.print(F("hello world")).

* The String class has been reimplemented as well, by Paul Stoffregen. This
  new version is more memory-efficient and robust. Some functions which
  previously returned new string instances (e.g. trim() and toUpperCase())
  have been changed to instead modify strings in place.

* Support for DHCP and DNS has been added to the Ethernet library, thanks
  to integration by Adrian McEwen. Most classes in the Ethernet library
  have been renamed to add a "Ethernet" prefix and avoid conflicts with
  other networking libraries. In particular, "Client" is now
  "EthernetClient", "Server" is "EthernetServer", and "UDP" is
  "EthernetUDP". A new IPAddress class makes it easier to manipulate
  those values.

* The UDP API has been changed to be more similar to other libraries.
  Outgoing packets are now constructed using calls to the standard write(),
  print(), and println() functions – bracketed by beginPacket() and
  endPacket(). The parsePacket() function checks for and parses an
  incoming packet, which can then be read using available(), read(), and
  peek(). The remoteIP() and remotePort() functions provide information
  about the packet’s origin. (Again, thanks to Adrian McEwen for the
  implementation.)

* The Wire library has also been modified to use the standard read() and
  write() functions instead of send() and receive(). You can also use
  print() and println() for outgoing data.

* The SD library now supports multiple simultaneous open files. It also
  provides the isDirectory(), openNextFile(), and rewindDirectory()
  functions for iterating through all the files in a directory. (Thanks
  to Limor Fried.)

[boards / firmwares]

* Added the Arduino Mini w/ ATmega328.

* Added Windows drivers (.inf files) and 16U2 firmware (.hex files) for
  the rev. 3 boards (Uno, Mega, and Mega ADK).  

[internals]

* The WProgram.h file, which provides declarations for the Arduino API,
  has been renamed to Arduino.h. To create a library that will work in
  both Arduino 0022 and Arduino 1.0, you can use an #ifdef that checks
  for the ARDUINO constant, which was 22 and is now 100.  For example:

  #if defined(ARDUINO) && ARDUINO >= 100
  #include "Arduino.h"
  #else
  #include "WProgram.h"
  #endif

* The write(), print(), and println() functions in Stream now return a
  size_t (instead of void). This indicates the number of bytes actually
  written by the function. Any classes that inherit from Stream will need
  to change accordingly. Additionally the write(str) function has been
  given a concrete implementation – it calls write(buf, len) - so
  sub-classes don't need to (and shouldn't) implement it.

* There are new abstract base-classes for Client, Server, and UDP to
  provide portability across networking libraries.

* The pin definitions for the Arduino boards (i.e. the mappings from pin
  numbers to port register / bit pairs) is now stored in a sub-folder of
  a new variants/ folder in the hardware folder. The variant to use for
  a given board is specified by the BOARD.build.variant preference in the
  boards.txt file.

* The new, variant-specific pins_arduino.h files now provides additional
  macros with information about the characteristics of the board (e.g.
  the locations of the SPI and TWI pins, and the number of digital and
  analog pins).

* The avrdude included with the Mac and Windows versions of the Arduino
  software has been upgraded to avrdude 5.11 (from an Arduino-specific
  version of avrdude 5.4). The software now uses the "arduino" programmer
  type in place of "stk500v1" for uploading to most Arduino boards.

* Working around problem that caused PWM output on pins 5 and 6 to never go
  to 0 (causing, for example, an LED to continue to glow faintly).
* Removing cast macros, since function-style casts are a feature of C++.  This
  should fix contributed libraries that broke in Arduino 0012.
* Modifying pulseIn() to wait for a transition to start timing (i.e. ignoring
  any pulse that had already started when the function was called).
* Fixing bug in random() that limited the ranges of values generated.  Thanks
  to Mikal Hart.
* Modifying delay() to pause for at least the given number of milliseconds.
* Fixing bug in Ethernet library that interfered with use of pins 8 and 9.
* Originating each outgoing network connection from a different port (in the
  Client class of the Ethernet library).  Thanks to Paul and joquer.
* Updating ATmega168 bootloader to work with standard distributions of avrdude
  (responding to signature requests made with the universal SPI command) and
  correctly store EEPROM data.  Thanks to ladyada.
  
[environment]
* Omitting unused functions from compiled sketches, reducing their size.
* Changing compilation process to allow for use of EEMEM directive (although
  not yet uploading EEPROM data).

ARDUINO 0012 - 2008.09.18

* Added Arduino Nano to the boards menu.
* Arduino Pro or Pro Mini (8 MHz) to the boards menu.
* Added Firmata library by Hans Steiner and others.  This provides a standard
  protocol for communicating with software on the computer.
* Added an Ethernet library for use with the Arduino Ethernet Shield.
* Added a Servo library based on the work of Jim Studt.
* Added a LiquidCrystal library based on the work in the playground.  It
  supports both 4- and 8-bit modes.
* Improved millis(): it now overflows after 49 days instead of 9 hours, but
  now uses slightly more processing power.
* Fixed reversing direction bug in Stepper library.  (Thanks to Wayne Holder.)
* Moved insertion of #include <WProgram.h> to after any comments and #include
  statements in the main sketch file.  This means that an #include <stdlib.h>
  now works.
* Upgraded to newer versions of avr-gcc (4.3.0) and avr-libc (1.6).  This
  provides support for newer Atmel chips, but may increase the size
  of sketches.
* Allowing per-board specification of the upload.using preference, allowing
  upload via bootloader to some boards and via a programmer to others.
* Added return values to some functions in the Wire library to allow for
  better error handling.
* Fixed random() to work with long values.
* Creation of an abstract Print base-class to allow Serial, SoftwareSerial,
  and LiquidCrystal to share code for print() and println().
* Incorporated ladyada's watchdog timer mods to the bootloader source, but
  only compiling them in for the Pro and Pro Mini (because they are included
  in the bootloader being burned on the boards by SparkFun).

ARDUINO 0011 - 2008.03.28

* Fixed Find in Reference.
* Added map() function for mapping values from one range to another.
* Added analogReference() function.

* Support for uploading sketch using a programmer.
* Improved detection of functions that need prototyping.
* Placing function prototypes after #include's and #define's.
* No longer moving #include statements to the top of the sketch.
* Can now drag .pde files onto the Arduino dock icon on Mac OS X.
  Thanks to Peter Sgouros.

* Added the ability to burn NG and Diecimila bootlaoders (with an AVRISPmkII).
* Fixed a bug in SoftwareSerial (a hardware serial function was being called
  instead of the software serial equivalent).  Thanks to brianbr for the
  report and fix.

ARDUINO 0008 - 2007.06.09

* Updated examples (in distribution and on the website).
* Added an EEPROM library (see reference for details).
* Added a Stepper motor library (see reference).
* Patched to reduce binary sketch sizes by building the Arduino core as
  a library (.a) file - now only the needed parts of the core are linked into
  a sketch.  Originally written by Nicolas Roland, revised by Don Cross.
* Fixed bug in Serial.available().  Report and fix by Don Cross.
* Now recompiling libraries when switching microcontrollers.  Report by
  Julian Bleecker; fix by Nicholas Zambetti.
* Cleaned up core functions: moved pin definitions into program space to save
  RAM, and other minor improvements.  Contributed by Jim Studt.
* Lots of reference additions and fixes from Paul Badger.
* Changed default microcontroller to ATmega168 from ATmega8.
* Removed the delay from analogRead().

  ATmega8).

ARDUINO 0007 - 2006.12.25

* Smaller core (about 3.5 KB instead of 4.5 KB).
* Added a SoftwareSerial library (thanks to Antonio, Heather Dewey-Hagborg, and
  bigengineer for their help).
* Implemented a Serial.flush() routine; see reference for details.
* Digital pins 0 and 1 can be used for i/o until a call to Serial.begin().
* Replaced avr-lib's uart routines with custom code for handling serial
  communication and modified C++ serial commands to call the C serial commands;
  the code may behave slightly differently in border cases (e.g. non-standard
  speeds, or on overflow).
* Added attachInterrupt() and detachInterrupt() functions for handling of
  external interrupts on pins 2 and 3.
* Implemented shiftOut() routine; see reference for details.
* Defining binary constants: e.g. B1010 is 6.

* Windows version comes with the FTDI USB drivers already unzipped.
* New Linux binary distribution (still requires some programs to be
  pre-installed).

ARDUINO 0006 - 2006.10.21

* Mac version no longer requires Java 1.5, meaning it should run on 10.3.9.
* Added support for analog inputs 6 and 7 and pwm on pins 5 and 6 on the
  on the ATmega168 used in the Arduino Mini (extra analog inputs not available
  in DIP ATmega168s).
* You now select the baud rate for the serial monitor from within the editor
  status bar when the serial monitor is running instead of from the Tools menu.
* Pressing enter within the serial monitor edit box no longer appends a newline
  to the message sent to the board.
* Included the Wire (TWI) library from Wiring.
* Updated the reference.

  (except operating on longs instead of floats).
* Fixed bug that sometimes caused uploading of old versions of a sketch.
* Serial monitor nows include an interface to send messages to the Arduino
  board.  Pressing return appends a newline, pushing the send button doesn't.

* Updated to latest version of the RXTX serial library; Mac users will need to
  rerun macosx_setup.command.

ARDUINO 0003 - 2006.01.16

API Changes
* Reversed the analog input pins to correspond to newer boards.  This means
  a call, for example, to analogRead(0) must be changed to analogRead(5) in
  order to read the same physical pin.
* Added a printNewline() function (which sends '\n' = ASCII 10).

New Stuff
* Reference is included (features native to C not yet documented).
* Serial monitor added (click the toolbar button to turn it on or off).  Baud
  rate is controlled by the Serial Monitor Baud Rate Menu, defaults to 9600.
  Icon and implementation from Wiring.
* Serial port menu now automatically refreshes when opened.
* New blue color scheme and icons courtesy of Noah Shibley (colors are hardcoded
  into the source to ensure consistency with image files).
* Keyspan and FTDI USB drivers included with Mac and Windows distributions.

Bug Fixes
* millis() now updates every millisecond instead of every second.
* Bootloader included with Windows distribution (it was already in the Mac
  dist).
* Updated icon of the Windows executable.
* Now flushing the serial port before uploading (should fix some errors).
* Improved accuracy of the delayMicroseconds() function.

Other
* Upload rate no longer selectable from a menu within the IDE.  Instead, edit
  the serial.download_rate item in the preferences.txt file.
* Created Xcode project for building Arduino on the Mac (doesn't yet regenerate
  the grammar files or package the distribution); active target should be "App".
* Removed unused or unimplemented items from menus.

ARDUINO 0002 - 2005.10.05

* New build process no longer uses makefiles; now controlled by preferences.txt.
* core/ replaced with targets/; can now link against Wiring libraries.
* Replaced print() with printString, printInteger, printHex, printByte, etc.
* Added menu for selecting serial port speed.
* Updated icon.
* Bootloader shrunk to less than 1 KB; fuses updated accordingly.
* Added serialRead(), serialAvailable(), and delayMicroseconds().

ARDUINO 0001 - 2005.08.25 

* This is the first released of the unified IDE + language library
  it's a terrible hack... but it works. at the moment it's in alpha stage
  but it can be used to work.
* The processing preprocessor is included but not used.
