MMU - Adjust the Ratio of ICACHE to IRAM
========================================

Overview
--------

The ESP8266 has a total of 64K of instruction memory, IRAM. This 64K of
IRAM is composed of one dedicated 32K block of IRAM and two 16K blocks
of IRAM. The last two 16K blocks of IRAM are flexible in the sense that
it can be used as a transparent cache for external flash memory. These
blocks can either be used for IRAM or an instruction cache for executing
code out of flash, ICACHE.

The code generated for a sketch is divided up into two groups, ICACHE
and IRAM. IRAM offers faster execution. It is used for interrupt service
routines, exception handling, and time-critical code. The ICACHE allows
for the execution of up to 1MB of code stored in flash. On a cache miss,
a delay occurs as the instructions are read from flash via the SPI bus.

There is 98KB of DRAM space. This memory can be accessed as byte, short,
or a 32-bit word. Access must be aligned according to the data type
size. A 16bit short must be on a multiple of 2-byte address boundary.
Likewise, a 32-bit word must be on a multiple of 4-byte address
boundary. In contrast, data access in IRAM or ICACHE must always be a
full 32-bit word and aligned. We will discuss a non32-bit exception
handler for this later.

Option Summary
--------------

The Arduino IDE Tools menu option, ``MMU`` has the following selections:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. ``32KB cache + 32KB IRAM (balanced)``

   -  This is the legacy ratio.
   -  Try this option 1st.

2. ``16KB cache + 48KB IRAM (IRAM)``

   -  With just 16KB cache, execution of code out of flash may be slowed
      by more cache misses when compared to 32KB. The slowness will vary
      with the sketch.
   -  Use this if you need a little more IRAM space, and you have enough
      DRAM space.

3. ``16KB cache + 48KB IRAM and 2nd Heap (shared)``

   -  This option builds on the previous option and creates a 2nd Heap
      made with IRAM.
   -  The 2nd Heap size will vary with free IRAM.
   -  This option is flexible. IRAM usage for code can overflow into the
      additional 16KB IRAM region, shrinking the 2nd Heap below 16KB. Or
      IRAM can be under 32KB, allowing the 2nd Heap to be larger than
      16KB.
   -  Installs a Non-32-Bit Access handler for IRAM. This allows for
      byte and 16-bit aligned short access.
   -  This 2nd Heap is supported by the standard ``malloc`` APIs.
   -  Heap selection is handled through a ``HeapSelect`` class. This
      allows a specific heap selection for the duration of a scope.
   -  Use this option, if you are still running out of DRAM space after
      you have moved as many of your constant strings/data elements that
      you can to PROGMEM.

4. ``16KB cache + 32KB IRAM + 16KB 2nd Heap (not shared)``

   -  Not managed by the ``umm_malloc`` heap library
   -  If required, non-32-Bit Access for IRAM must be enabled
      separately.
   -  Enables a 16KB block of unmanaged IRAM memory
   -  Data persist across reboots, but not deep sleep.
   -  Works well for when you need a simple large chunk of memory. This
      option will reduce the resources required to support a shared 2nd
      Heap.

The Arduino IDE Tools menu option, ``Non-32-Bit Access`` has the following selections:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``Use pgm_read macros for IRAM/PROGMEM``
-  ``Byte/Word access to IRAM/PROGMEM (very slow)``

   -  This option adds a non32-bit exception handler to your build.
   -  Handles read/writes to IRAM and reads to ICACHE.
   -  Supports short and byte access to IRAM
   -  Not recommended for high-frequency access data, use DRAM if you
      can.
   -  Expect it to be slower than DRAM, each character access, will
      require a complete save and restore of all 16+ registers.
   -  Processing an exception uses 256 bytes of stack space just to get
      started. The actual handler will add a little more.
   -  This option is implicitly enabled and required when you select MMU
      option ``16KB cache + 48KB IRAM and 2nd Heap (shared)``.

IRAM, unlike DRAM, must be accessed as aligned full 32-bit words, no
byte or short access. The pgm_read macros are an option; however, the
store operation remains an issue. For a block copy, ets_memcpy appears
to work well as long as the byte count is rounded up to be evenly
divided by 4, and source and destination addresses are 4 bytes aligned.

A word of caution, I have seen one case with the new toolchain 10.1
where code that reads a 32-bit word to extract a byte was optimized away
to be a byte read. Using ``volatile`` on the pointer stopped the
over-optimization.

To get a sense of how memory access time is effected, see examples
``MMU48K`` and ``irammem`` in ``ESP8266``.

NON-OS SDK v3.0.0 and above have builtin support for Non-32-Bit Access.
Selecting ``Byte/Word access to IRAM/PROGMEM`` will override the builtin
version with ours. However, there is no known reason to do this other
than debugging.

Miscellaneous
-------------

For calls to ``umm_malloc`` with interrupts disabled.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``malloc`` will always allocate from the ``DRAM`` heap when called
   with interrupts disabled.

   -  ``realloc`` with a NULL pointer will use ``malloc`` and return a
      ``DRAM`` heap allocation. Note, calling ``realloc`` with
      interrupts disabled is **not** officially supported. You are on
      your own if you do this.

-  If you must use IRAM memory in your ISR, allocate the memory in your
   init code. To reduce the time spent in the ISR, avoid non32-bit
   access that would trigger the exception handler. For short or byte
   access, consider using the inline functions described in section
   “Performance Functions” below.

How to Select Heap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``MMU`` selection ``16KB cache + 48KB IRAM and 2nd Heap (shared)``
allows you to use the standard heap API function calls (``malloc``,
``calloc``, ``free``, … ). to allocate memory from DRAM or IRAM. This
selection can be made by instantiating the class ``HeapSelectIram`` or
``HeapSelectDram``. The usage is similar to that of the
``InterruptLock`` class. The default/initial heap source is DRAM. The
class is in ``umm_malloc/umm_heap_select.h``.

.. code:: cpp

     ...
       char *bufferDram;
       bufferDram = (char *)malloc(33);
       char *bufferIram;
       {
           HeapSelectIram ephemeral;
           bufferIram = (char *)malloc(33);
       }
     ...
       free(bufferIram);
       free(bufferDram);
     ...

``free`` will always return memory to the correct heap. There is no need
for tracking and selecting before freeing.

``realloc`` with a non-NULL pointer will always resize the allocation
from the original heap it was allocated from. When the supplied pointer
is NULL, then the current heap selection is used.

Low-level primitives for selecting a heap. These are used by the above
Classes:

-  ``umm_get_current_heap_id()``
-  ``umm_set_heap_by_id( ID value )``
-  Possible ID values

   -  ``UMM_HEAP_DRAM``
   -  ``UMM_HEAP_IRAM``

Also, an alternate stack select method API is available. This is not as
easy as the class method; however, for some small set of cases, it may
provide some additional control:

-  ``ESP.setIramHeap()`` Pushes current heap ID onto a stack and sets
   Heap API for an IRAM selection.
-  ``ESP.setDramHeap()`` Pushes current heap ID onto a stack and sets
   Heap API for a DRAM selection.
-  ``ESP.resetHeap()`` Restores previously pushed heap. ### Identify
   Memory

These always inlined functions can be used to determine the resource of
a pointer:

.. code:: cpp

   bool mmu_is_iram(const void *addr);
   bool mmu_is_dram(const void *addr);
   bool mmu_is_icache(const void *addr);

Performance Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While these always inlined functions, will bypass the need for the
exception handler reducing execution time and stack use, it comes at the
cost of increased code size.

These are an alternative to the ``pgm_read`` macros for reading from
IRAM. When compiled with ‘Debug Level: core’ range checks are performed
on the pointer value to make sure you are reading from the address range
of IRAM, DRAM, or ICACHE.

.. code:: cpp

   uint8_t mmu_get_uint8(const void *p8);
   uint16_t mmu_get_uint16(const uint16_t *p16);
   int16_t mmu_get_int16(const int16_t *p16);

While these functions are intended for writing to IRAM, they will work
with DRAM. When compiled with ‘Debug Level: core’, range checks are
performed on the pointer value to make sure you are writing to the
address range of IRAM or DRAM.

.. code:: cpp

   uint8_t mmu_set_uint8(void *p8, const uint8_t val);
   uint16_t mmu_set_uint16(uint16_t *p16, const uint16_t val);
   int16_t mmu_set_int16(int16_t *p16, const int16_t val);
