Libraries
=========

WiFi(ESP8266WiFi library)
-------------------------

ESP8266WiFi library has been developed basing on ESP8266 SDK, using naming convention and overall functionality philosophy of the `Arduino WiFi Shield library <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFi>`__. Over time the wealth Wi-Fi features ported from ESP8266 SDK to this library outgrew the APIs of WiFi Shield library and it became apparent that we need to provide separate documentation on what is new and extra.

`ESP8266WiFi library documentation <esp8266wifi/readme.rst>`__

Ticker
------

Library for calling functions repeatedly with a certain period. `Two examples <https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/Ticker/examples>`__ included.

It is currently not recommended to do blocking IO operations (network, serial, file) from Ticker callback functions. Instead, set a flag inside the ticker callback and check for that flag inside the loop function.

Here is library to simplificate ``Ticker`` usage and avoid WDT reset:
`TickerScheduler <https://github.com/Toshik/TickerScheduler>`__

EEPROM
------

This is a bit different from standard EEPROM class. You need to call ``EEPROM.begin(size)`` before you start reading or writing, size being the number of bytes you want to use. Size can be anywhere between 4 and 4096 bytes.

``EEPROM.write`` does not write to flash immediately, instead you must call ``EEPROM.commit()`` whenever you wish to save changes to flash. ``EEPROM.end()`` will also commit, and will release the RAM copy of EEPROM contents.

EEPROM library uses one sector of flash located just after the SPIFFS.

`Three examples <https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/EEPROM>`__  included.

I2C (Wire library)
------------------

Wire library currently supports master mode up to approximately 450KHz. Before using I2C, pins for SDA and SCL need to be set by calling ``Wire.begin(int sda, int scl)``, i.e. ``Wire.begin(0, 2)`` on ESP-01, else they default to pins 4(SDA) and 5(SCL).

SPI
---

SPI library supports the entire Arduino SPI API including transactions, including setting phase (CPHA). Setting the Clock polarity (CPOL) is not supported, yet (SPI\_MODE2 and SPI\_MODE3 not working).

The usual SPI pins are: 

- ``MOSI`` = GPIO13
- ``MISO`` = GPIO12
- ``SCLK`` = GPIO14

There's an extended mode where you can swap the normal pins to the SPI0 hardware pins.
This is enabled  by calling ``SPI.pins(6, 7, 8, 0)`` before the call to ``SPI.begin()``. The pins would
change to:

- ``MOSI`` = SD1
- ``MISO`` = SD0
- ``SCLK`` = CLK
- ``HWCS`` = GPIO0

This mode shares the SPI pins with the controller that reads the program code from flash and is
controlled by a hardware arbiter (the flash has always higher priority). For this mode the CS
will be controlled by hardware as you can't handle the CS line with a GPIO, you never actually
know when the arbiter is going to grant you access to the bus so you must let it handle CS
automatically.


SoftwareSerial
--------------

An ESP8266 port of SoftwareSerial library done by Peter Lerup (@plerup) supports baud rate up to 115200 and multiples SoftwareSerial instances. See https://github.com/plerup/espsoftwareserial if you want to suggest an improvement or open an issue related to SoftwareSerial.

ESP-specific APIs
-----------------

Some ESP-specific APIs related to deep sleep, RTC and flash memories are available in the ``ESP`` object.

``ESP.deepSleep(microseconds, mode)`` will put the chip into deep sleep. ``mode`` is one of ``WAKE_RF_DEFAULT``, ``WAKE_RFCAL``, ``WAKE_NO_RFCAL``, ``WAKE_RF_DISABLED``. (GPIO16 needs to be tied to RST to wake from deepSleep.) The chip can sleep for at most ``ESP.deepSleepMax()`` microseconds.

``ESP.deepSleepInstant(microseconds, mode)`` works similarly to ``ESP.deepSleep`` but  sleeps instantly without waiting for WiFi to shutdown.

``ESP.rtcUserMemoryWrite(offset, &data, sizeof(data))`` and ``ESP.rtcUserMemoryRead(offset, &data, sizeof(data))`` allow data to be stored in and retrieved from the RTC user memory of the chip respectively. Total size of RTC user memory is 512 bytes, so ``offset + sizeof(data)`` shouldn't exceed 512. Data should be 4-byte aligned. The stored data can be retained between deep sleep cycles. However, the data might be lost after power cycling the chip.

``ESP.restart()`` restarts the CPU.

``ESP.getResetReason()`` returns a String containing the last reset reason in human readable format.

``ESP.getFreeHeap()`` returns the free heap size.

``ESP.getChipId()`` returns the ESP8266 chip ID as a 32-bit integer.

``ESP.getCoreVersion()`` returns a String containing the core version.

``ESP.getSdkVersion()`` returns the SDK version as a char.

``ESP.getCpuFreqMHz()`` returns the CPU frequency in MHz as an unsigned 8-bit integer.

``ESP.getSketchSize()`` returns the size of the current sketch as an unsigned 32-bit integer.

``ESP.getFreeSketchSpace()`` returns the free sketch space as an unsigned 32-bit integer.

``ESP.getSketchMD5()`` returns a lowercase String containing the MD5 of the current sketch.

``ESP.getFlashChipId()`` returns the flash chip ID as a 32-bit integer.

``ESP.getFlashChipSize()`` returns the flash chip size, in bytes, as seen by the SDK (may be less than actual size).

``ESP.getFlashChipRealSize()`` returns the real chip size, in bytes, based on the flash chip ID.

``ESP.getFlashChipSpeed(void)`` returns the flash chip frequency, in Hz.

``ESP.getCycleCount()`` returns the cpu instruction cycle count since start as an unsigned 32-bit. This is useful for accurate timing of very short actions like bit banging.

``ESP.getVcc()`` may be used to measure supply voltage. ESP needs to reconfigure the ADC at startup in order for this feature to be available. Add the following line to the top of your sketch to use ``getVcc``:

.. code:: cpp

    ADC_MODE(ADC_VCC);

TOUT pin has to be disconnected in this mode.

Note that by default ADC is configured to read from TOUT pin using ``analogRead(A0)``, and ``ESP.getVCC()`` is not available.

mDNS and DNS-SD responder (ESP8266mDNS library)
-----------------------------------------------

Allows the sketch to respond to multicast DNS queries for domain names like "foo.local", and DNS-SD (service discovery) queries. See attached example for details.

SSDP responder (ESP8266SSDP)
----------------------------

SSDP is another service discovery protocol, supported on Windows out of the box. See attached example for reference.

DNS server (DNSServer library)
------------------------------

Implements a simple DNS server that can be used in both STA and AP modes. The DNS server currently supports only one domain (for all other domains it will reply with NXDOMAIN or custom status code). With it, clients can open a web server running on ESP8266 using a domain name, not an IP address.

Servo
-----

This library exposes the ability to control RC (hobby) servo motors. It will support up to 24 servos on any available output pin. By default the first 12 servos will use Timer0 and currently this will not interfere with any other support. Servo counts above 12 will use Timer1 and features that use it will be affected. While many RC servo motors will accept the 3.3V IO data pin from a ESP8266, most will not be able to run off 3.3v and will require another power source that matches their specifications. Make sure to connect the grounds between the ESP8266 and the servo motor power supply.

Improved EEPROM library for ESP (ESP_EEPROM)
--------------------------------------------

An improved EEPROM library for ESPxxxx.  Uses flash memory as per the standard ESP EEPROM library but reduces reflash - so reducing wear and improving commit() performance.  

As actions on the flash need to stop the interrupts, an EEPROM reflash could noticably affect anything using PWM, etc.
