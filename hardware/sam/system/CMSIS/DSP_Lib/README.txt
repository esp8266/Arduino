The CMSIS DSP Software Library is a suite of common signal processing functions targeted to Cortex-M processor based microcontrollers. Even though the code has been specifically optimized towards using the extended DSP instruction set of the Cortex-M4 processor, the library can be compiled for any Cortex-M processor.

The CMSIS DSP Software Library is released under the terms of the end user license agreement ( "CMSIS END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT.pdf" ) located in the base directory of this package. Any user of the software package is bound to the terms and conditions of the end user license agreement.

Under the top level of this released package, you will find the following sub-directories:

CM4                - Contains the CMSIS library elements for Cortex-M4 called by the CMSIS DSP Library functions
CM3                - Contains the CMSIS library elements for Cortex-M3 called by the CMSIS DSP Library functions
CM0                - Contains the CMSIS library elements for Cortex-M0
Documentation      - Contains complete HTML documentation 
DSP_Lib            - MDK project files, Examples and source files etc.. to build the library for Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 processors
