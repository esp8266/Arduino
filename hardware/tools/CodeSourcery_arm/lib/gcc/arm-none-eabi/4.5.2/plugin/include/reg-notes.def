/* REG_DEP_TRUE is used in scheduler dependencies lists to represent a
   read-after-write dependency (i.e. a true data dependency).  This is
   here, not grouped with REG_DEP_ANTI and REG_DEP_OUTPUT, because some
   passes use a literal 0 for it.  */
REG_NOTE (DEP_TRUE)

/* The value in REG dies in this insn (i.e., it is not needed past
   this insn).  If REG is set in this insn, the REG_DEAD note may,
   but need not, be omitted.  */
REG_NOTE (DEAD)

/* The REG is autoincremented or autodecremented in this insn.  */
REG_NOTE (INC)

/* Describes the insn as a whole; it says that the insn sets a
   register to a constant value or to be equivalent to a memory
   address.  If the register is spilled to the stack then the constant
   value should be substituted for it.  The contents of the REG_EQUIV
   is the constant value or memory address, which may be different
   from the source of the SET although it has the same value.  A
   REG_EQUIV note may also appear on an insn which copies a register
   parameter to a pseudo-register, if there is a memory address which
   could be used to hold that pseudo-register throughout the function.  */
REG_NOTE (EQUIV)

/* Like REG_EQUIV except that the destination is only momentarily
   equal to the specified rtx.  Therefore, it cannot be used for
   substitution; but it can be used for cse.  */
REG_NOTE (EQUAL)

/* The register is always nonnegative during the containing loop.
   This is used in branches so that decrement and branch instructions
   terminating on zero can be matched.  There must be an insn pattern
   in the md file named `decrement_and_branch_until_zero' or else this
   will never be added to any instructions.  */
REG_NOTE (NONNEG)

/* Identifies a register set in this insn and never used.  */
REG_NOTE (UNUSED)

/* REG_CC_SETTER and REG_CC_USER link a pair of insns that set and use
   CC0, respectively.  Normally, these are required to be consecutive
   insns, but we permit putting a cc0-setting insn in the delay slot
   of a branch as long as only one copy of the insn exists.  In that
   case, these notes point from one to the other to allow code
   generation to determine what any require information and to
   properly update CC_STATUS.  These notes are INSN_LISTs.  */

REG_NOTE (CC_USER)

/* Points to a CODE_LABEL.  Used by JUMP_INSNs to say that the CODE_LABEL

   this insn.  This note is an INSN_LIST.  */
REG_NOTE (LABEL_TARGET)

/* Points to a CODE_LABEL.  Used by any insn to say that the CODE_LABEL
   contained in the REG_LABEL_OPERAND note is used by the insn, but as an
   operand, not as a jump target (though it may indirectly be a jump
   target for a later jump insn).  This note is an INSN_LIST.  */

/* REG_BR_PROB is attached to JUMP_INSNs and CALL_INSNs.  It has an

/* REG_VALUE_PROFILE is attached when the profile is read in to an

/* Attached to a call insn; indicates that the call is malloc-like and
   that the pointer returned cannot alias anything else.  */
REG_NOTE (NOALIAS)

/* REG_BR_PRED is attached to JUMP_INSNs and CALL_INSNSs.  It contains
   CONCAT of two integer value.  First specifies the branch predictor
   that added the note, second specifies the predicted hitrate of
   branch in the same format as REG_BR_PROB note uses.  */

/* Attached to insns that are RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P, but are too complex
   for DWARF to interpret what they imply.  The attached rtx is used
   instead of intuition.  */
REG_NOTE (FRAME_RELATED_EXPR)

/* Attached to insns that are RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P, but are too complex
   for FRAME_RELATED_EXPR intuition.  The insn's first pattern must be
   a SET, and the destination must be the CFA register.  The attached
   rtx is an expression that defines the CFA.  In the simplest case, the
   rtx could be just the stack_pointer_rtx; more common would be a PLUS
   with a base register and a constant offset.  In the most complicated
   cases, this will result in a DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression with the rtx
   expression rendered in a dwarf location expression.  */
REG_NOTE (CFA_DEF_CFA)

/* Attached to insns that are RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P, but are too complex
   for FRAME_RELATED_EXPR intuition.  This note adjusts the expression
   from which the CFA is computed.  The attached rtx defines a new CFA
   expression, relative to the old CFA expression.  This rtx must be of
   the form (SET new-cfa-reg (PLUS old-cfa-reg const_int)).  If the note
   rtx is NULL, we use the first SET of the insn.  */
REG_NOTE (CFA_ADJUST_CFA)

/* Similar to FRAME_RELATED_EXPR, with the additional information that
   this is a save to memory, i.e. will result in DW_CFA_offset or the
   like.  The pattern or the insn should be a simple store relative to
   the CFA.  */
REG_NOTE (CFA_OFFSET)

/* Similar to FRAME_RELATED_EXPR, with the additional information that this
   is a save to a register, i.e. will result in DW_CFA_register.  The insn
   or the pattern should be simple reg-reg move.  */
REG_NOTE (CFA_REGISTER)

/* Attached to insns that are RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P, with the information
   that this is a restore operation, i.e. will result in DW_CFA_restore
   or the like.  Either the attached rtx, or the destination of the insn's
   first pattern is the register to be restored.  */
REG_NOTE (CFA_RESTORE)

/* Attached to insn that is RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P, marks insn that sets
   vDRAP from DRAP.  If vDRAP is a register, vdrap_reg is initalized
   to the argument, if it is a MEM, it is ignored.  */
REG_NOTE (CFA_SET_VDRAP)

/* Indicates that REG holds the exception context for the function.
   This context is shared by inline functions, so the code to acquire
   the real exception context is delayed until after inlining.  */
REG_NOTE (EH_CONTEXT)

/* Indicates what exception region an INSN belongs in.  This is used
   to indicate what region to which a call may throw.  REGION 0
   indicates that a call cannot throw at all.  REGION -1 indicates
   that it cannot throw, nor will it execute a non-local goto.  */
REG_NOTE (EH_REGION)

/* Used by haifa-sched to save NOTE_INSN notes across scheduling.  */
REG_NOTE (SAVE_NOTE)

/* Indicates that a call does not return.  */
REG_NOTE (NORETURN)

/* Indicates that an indirect jump is a non-local goto instead of a
   computed goto.  */
REG_NOTE (NON_LOCAL_GOTO)

/* Indicates that a jump crosses between hot and cold sections in a
   (partitioned) assembly or .o file, and therefore should not be
   reduced to a simpler jump by optimizations.  */
REG_NOTE (CROSSING_JUMP)

/* This kind of note is generated at each to `setjmp', and similar
   functions that can return twice.  */
REG_NOTE (SETJMP)
