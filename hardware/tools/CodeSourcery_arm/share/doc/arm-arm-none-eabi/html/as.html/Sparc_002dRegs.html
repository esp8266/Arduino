<h5 class="subsubsection">9.35.3.2 Register Names</h5>

<p><a name="index-Sparc-registers-1643"></a><a name="index-register-names_002c-Sparc-1644"></a>
The Sparc integer register file is broken down into global,
outgoing, local, and incoming.

     <ul>
<li>The 8 global registers are referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The 8 outgoing registers are referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%o</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The 8 local registers are referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%l</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The 8 incoming registers are referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%i</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The frame pointer register &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%i6</span></samp>&rsquo; can be referenced using
the alias &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%fp</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The stack pointer register &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%o6</span></samp>&rsquo; can be referenced using
the alias &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%sp</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
</ul>

   <p>Floating point registers are simply referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%f</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;. 
When assembling for pre-V9, only 32 floating point registers
are available.  For V9 and later there are 64, but there are
restrictions when referencing the upper 32 registers.  They
can only be accessed as double or quad, and thus only even
or quad numbered accesses are allowed.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%f34</span></samp>&rsquo;
is a legal floating point register, but &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%f35</span></samp>&rsquo; is not.

   <p>Certain V9 instructions allow access to ancillary state registers. 
Most simply they can be referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%asr</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo; where
<var>n</var> can be from 16 to 31.  However, there are some aliases
defined to reference ASR registers defined for various UltraSPARC
processors:

     <ul>
<li>The tick compare register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%tick_cmpr</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The system tick register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%stick</span></samp>&rsquo;.  An alias,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%sys_tick</span></samp>&rsquo;, exists but is deprecated and should not be used
by new software.

     <li>The system tick compare register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%stick_cmpr</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
An alias, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%sys_tick_cmpr</span></samp>&rsquo;, exists but is deprecated and should
not be used by new software.

     <li>The software interrupt register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%softint</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The set software interrupt register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%set_softint</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The mnemonic &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%softint_set</span></samp>&rsquo; is provided as an alias.

     <li>The clear software interrupt register is referred to as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%clear_softint</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The mnemonic &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%softint_clear</span></samp>&rsquo; is provided
as an alias.

     <li>The performance instrumentation counters register is referred to as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%pic</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The performance control register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%pcr</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The graphics status register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%gsr</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The V9 dispatch control register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%dcr</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
</ul>

   <p>Various V9 branch and conditional move instructions allow
specification of which set of integer condition codes to
test.  These are referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%xcc</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%icc</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>In V9, there are 4 sets of floating point condition codes
which are referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%fcc</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Several special privileged and non-privileged registers
exist:

     <ul>
<li>The V9 address space identifier register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%asi</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The V9 restorable windows register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%canrestore</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The V9 savable windows register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%cansave</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The V9 clean windows register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%cleanwin</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The V9 current window pointer register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%cwp</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The floating-point queue register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%fq</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The V8 co-processor queue register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%cq</span></samp>&rsquo;.

</ul>

   <p>Several special register names exist for hypervisor mode code:

     <ul>
<li>The hyperprivileged processor state register is referred to as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%hpstate</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The hyperprivileged trap state register is referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%htstate</span></samp>&rsquo;.
