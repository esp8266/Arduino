     CS3 is CodeSourcery's low-level board support library.
     This chapter documents the boards
     supported by Sourcery G++ Lite and the compiler and linker 
     options you need to use with them.
     It also explains how you can use and modify CS3-provided
     definitions for memory maps, system startup code and
     interrupt vectors in your own code.

    Many developers turn to the GNU toolchain for its cross-platform
    consistency: having a single system support so many different
    processors and boards helps to limit risk and keep learning curves
    gentle.  Historically, however, the GNU toolchain has lacked a
    consistent set of conventions for processor- and board-level
    initialization, language run-time setup, and interrupt and trap
    handler definition.
  </p><p>
    The CodeSourcery Common Startup Code Sequence (CS3) addresses
    this problem.  For each supported system, CS3 provides a set of
    linker scripts describing the system's memory map, and a board
    support library providing generic reset, startup, and interrupt
    handlers.  These scripts and libraries all follow a standard set
    of conventions across a range of processors and boards.
  </p><p>
    In addition to providing linker support, CS3's functionality is 
    fully integrated with the Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite.  For each
    supported board, CS3 provides the board file containing the 
    memory map and initialization sequence required for debugging 
    applications on the board via the Sprite, as documented in
    <a class="xref" href="sec-sprite-supported-boards.html" title="6.9. Supported Board Files">Section 6.9, &#8220;Supported Board Files&#8221;</a>.
  </p><p>
    This chapter is organized in two parts.  The first part explains
    CS3 concepts:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><a class="xref" href="chap-cs3.html#sec-cs3-linker-scripts" title="5.1. Linker Scripts">Section 5.1, &#8220;Linker Scripts&#8221;</a> provides basic information
        you need to know in order to select an appropriate
        CS3-provided linker script for your ARM EABI board.  
      </li><li>
	CS3's program startup and termination model is discussed in
	<a class="xref" href="sec-cs3-startup.html" title="5.2. Program Startup and Termination">Section 5.2, &#8220;Program Startup and Termination&#8221;</a>.
      </li><li><a class="xref" href="sec-cs3-memory-layout.html" title="5.3. Memory Layout">Section 5.3, &#8220;Memory Layout&#8221;</a>
	discusses the mapping from program sections to memory regions.
	It also explains how you can refer to
	memory regions using CS3-provided symbolic names from C,
	assembly language, or the linker script, and customize placement
	of code or data in your program.
      </li><li><a class="xref" href="sec-cs3-interrupts.html" title="5.4. Interrupt Vectors and Handlers">Section 5.4, &#8220;Interrupt Vectors and Handlers&#8221;</a> covers CS3's interrupt
	handling model, and discusses how you can customize the CS3-provided
	interrupt vector tables.
      </li></ul></div><p>
    The second part provides details about the CS3 implementation for
    ARM EABI:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><a class="xref" href="sec-cs3-supported-boards.html" title="5.5. Supported Boards for ARM EABI">Section 5.5, &#8220;Supported Boards for ARM EABI&#8221;</a> lists the boards
	supported by CS3 for ARM EABI, and the available linker
	scripts for them.
      </li><li><a class="xref" href="sec-cs3-vector-tables.html" title="5.6. Interrupt Vector Tables">Section 5.6, &#8220;Interrupt Vector Tables&#8221;</a>
        documents the details of the provided interrupt vectors
	for CS3-supported devices.
      </li></ul></div><p>
  </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sec-cs3-linker-scripts"></a>5.1. Linker Scripts</h2></div></div></div><p>
      When you build programs for ARM EABI targets, you must
      use a linker script.  The linker script serves several purposes:

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
	  It determines the memory addresses for placement of code and
	  data sections.
        </li><li>
	  It defines symbolic names for memory regions present on the
	  board, which you can use programmatically within your code.
        </li><li>
	  It provides appropriate program startup and termination code,
	  and causes the linker to pull in any low-level board support
	  libraries that are required to run code on the target.
        </li><li>
	  It optionally provides a <em class="firstterm">hosting</em> library
	  for basic I/O functionality.
        </li><li>
	  It provides a default interrupt vector appropriate for the
	  target processor.
        </li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
      
      When invoking the Sourcery G++ linker from the command line,
      you must explicitly supply a linker script using the
      <code class="option">-T</code> option; otherwise a link error results.
    </p><p>
      CS3 may provide multiple linker scripts for different configurations
      using the same board.  For example, on some boards CS3 may support
      running the program from either RAM or ROM (flash).
      Some CS3 link configurations are also designed to co-exist with, or be
      run from, a boot monitor on the target board.
      Simulator targets typically require different startup code configurations
      than hardware targets.
      In CS3 terminology, each of these different
      configurations is referred to as a <em class="firstterm">profile</em>.
    </p><p>
      The remainder of this section discusses profile and hosting
      selection considerations in more detail.  You can find the full
      list of supported boards and linker scripts included in this
      release of Sourcery G++ Lite in <a class="xref" href="sec-cs3-supported-boards.html" title="5.5. Supported Boards for ARM EABI">Section 5.5, &#8220;Supported Boards for ARM EABI&#8221;</a>.
    </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id279080"></a>5.1.1. Program and Data Placement</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Many boards have both RAM and ROM (flash) memory devices.  CS3
        provides distinct linker scripts to place the application either
        entirely in RAM, or to place code and read-only data in ROM.
      </p><p>
        Some boards have very small amounts of RAM memory.  If you use
        large library functions (such as <code class="function">printf</code> and
        <code class="function">malloc</code>), you may overflow the available
        memory.  You may need to use the ROM-based profile for
        such programs, so that the program itself is stored in ROM.  You
        may be able to reduce the total amount of memory used by your
        program by replacing portions of the Sourcery G++ runtime library
        and/or startup code.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sec-cs3-semihosting"></a>5.1.2. Hosting and Semihosting</h3></div></div></div><p>
        CS3 is designed to support boards without an operating system.
        To allow functions like
        <code class="function">open</code> and <code class="function">write</code> to
        work without operating system support, a
        <em class="firstterm">semihosting</em> feature is
        supported, in conjunction with the debugger.
      </p><p>
        With semihosting enabled, these system calls are translated
        into equivalent function calls on your host system.  You can
        only use these function calls while connected to the debugger;
        if you try to use them when disconnected from the debugger,
        you will get a hardware exception.
      </p><p>
        Semihosting requires support from the remote GDB debugging stub 
        or agent, as well as the debugger itself.
        <span>
          The Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite implements semihosting for all
          supported devices.
        </span>
        <span>
          Semihosting is
          <span>also</span>
          supported by the
          <span>
            GDB Simulator
            
          </span>
          
          included with Sourcery G++ Lite.
        </span>
        However, semihosting may not be supported by debugging stubs
        provided by third parties.  If you are using a debug device that
        communicates with GDB using the GDB remote protocol,
        check the documentation for your device to see whether semihosting
        is supported.
      </p><p>
        A good use of semihosting is to display debugging messages.  For
        example, this program prints a message on the debugger console
        on the host:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main () {
  write (STDERR_FILENO, "Hello, world!\n", 14);
  return 0;
}</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        The hosted CS3 linker scripts provide the semihosting support,
        and as such programs linked with them may only be run with the
        debugger.  For production code, or programs where memory usage
	is tightly constrained, use the unhosted CS3 linker scripts
	instead.
	These scripts provide stub versions of the system calls,
	which return an appropriate
        error value in <code class="varname">errno</code>.  If such a stub
        system call is required in the executable, the linker also
        produces a warning.  Such a warning may indicate that you have
        left debugging code active, or that your program contains unused
	code.
      </p><p>
        As an alternative to semihosting via the debugger,
	some targets supported by CS3 can run a boot monitor that 
        provides console I/O services and other basic system calls.
        CS3 can also provide hosting via these facilities; where a boot
        monitor is supported, this is noted in the board tables below.
        Unlike semihosting, hosting via the boot monitor can be used when
        running programs outside of the debugger.

        When using Sourcery G++ from the command line or from a 
	<code class="filename">Makefile</code>, you must add <code class="option">-T
        <em class="replaceable"><code>script</code></em></code> to your linking
        command, where <em class="replaceable"><code>script</code></em> is the
        appropriate linker script.  For example, to target
        ARMulator (RDI) boards, you could link with <code class="option">-T
        armulator-ram-hosted.ld</code>.
