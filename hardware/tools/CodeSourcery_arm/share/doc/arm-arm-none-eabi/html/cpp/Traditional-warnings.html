<h3 class="section">10.4 Traditional warnings</h3>

<p>You can request warnings about features that did not exist, or worked
differently, in traditional C with the <samp><span class="option">-Wtraditional</span></samp> option. 
GCC does not warn about features of ISO C which you must use when you
are using a conforming compiler, such as the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">##</span></samp>&rsquo;
operators.

   <p>Presently <samp><span class="option">-Wtraditional</span></samp> warns about:

     <ul>
<li>Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body. 
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but does not in ISO C.

     <li>In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist. 
Traditional preprocessors would only consider a line to be a directive
if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
<samp><span class="option">-Wtraditional</span></samp> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but would ignore because the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma</span></samp>&rsquo; not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations would not recognize &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#elif</span></samp>&rsquo;, so it
suggests avoiding it altogether.

     <li>A function-like macro that appears without an argument list.  In some
traditional preprocessors this was an error.  In ISO C it merely means
that the macro is not expanded.

     <li>The unary plus operator.  This did not exist in traditional C.

     <li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">U</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LL</span></samp>&rsquo; integer constant suffixes, which were not
available in traditional C.  (Traditional C does support the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo;
suffix for simple long integer constants.)  You are not warned about
uses of these suffixes in macros defined in system headers.  For
instance, <code>UINT_MAX</code> may well be defined as <code>4294967295U</code>, but
you will not be warned if you use <code>UINT_MAX</code>.

     <p>You can usually avoid the warning, and the related warning about
constants which are so large that they are unsigned, by writing the
integer constant in question in hexadecimal, with no U suffix.  Take
care, though, because this gives the wrong result in exotic cases. 
</ul>
