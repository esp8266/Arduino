<h3 class="section">3.6 Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialects</h3>

<p><a name="index-compiler-options_002c-Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-187"></a><a name="index-Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-options_002c-command-line-188"></a><a name="index-options_002c-Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-189"></a>(NOTE: This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective-C++
languages themselves.  See See <a href="Standards.html#Standards">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for references.)

 <p>This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs, but you can also use most of
the language-independent GNU compiler options. 
For example, you might compile a file <code>some_class.m</code> like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">In this example, <samp><span class="option">-fgnu-runtime</span></samp> is an option meant only for
Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs; you can use the other options with
any language supported by GCC.

 <p>Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C
compilations may also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
<samp><span class="option">-Wtraditional</span></samp>).  Similarly, Objective-C++ compilations may use
C++-specific options (e.g., <samp><span class="option">-Wabi</span></samp>).

 <p>Here is a list of options that are <em>only</em> for compiling Objective-C
and Objective-C++ programs:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fconstant-string-class=</code><var>class-name</var><dd><a name="index-fconstant_002dstring_002dclass-190"></a>Use <var>class-name</var> as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax <code>@"..."</code>.  The default
class name is <code>NXConstantString</code> if the GNU runtime is being used, and
<code>NSConstantString</code> if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
<samp><span class="option">-fconstant-cfstrings</span></samp> option, if also present, will override the
<samp><span class="option">-fconstant-string-class</span></samp> setting and cause <code>@"..."</code> literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.

     <br><dt><code>-fgnu-runtime</code><dd><a name="index-fgnu_002druntime-191"></a>Generate object code compatible with the standard GNU Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.

     <br><dt><code>-fnext-runtime</code><dd><a name="index-fnext_002druntime-192"></a>Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac OS X.  The macro
<code>__NEXT_RUNTIME__</code> is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-nil-receivers</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dnil_002dreceivers-193"></a>Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (e.g.,
<code>[receiver message:arg]</code>) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver
is not <code>nil</code>.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the runtime
to be used.  Currently, this option is only available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.3 and later.

     <br><dt><code>-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors</code><dd><a name="index-fobjc_002dcall_002dcxx_002dcdtors-194"></a>For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a
C++ object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a
special <code>- (id) .cxx_construct</code> instance method that will run
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order,
and then return <code>self</code>.  Similarly, check if any instance variable
is a C++ object with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special <code>- (void) .cxx_destruct</code> method that will run
all such default destructors, in reverse order.

     <p>The <code>- (id) .cxx_construct</code> and/or <code>- (void) .cxx_destruct</code> methods
thusly generated will only operate on instance variables declared in the
current Objective-C class, and not those inherited from superclasses.  It
is the responsibility of the Objective-C runtime to invoke all such methods
in an object's inheritance hierarchy.  The <code>- (id) .cxx_construct</code> methods
will be invoked by the runtime immediately after a new object
instance is allocated; the <code>- (void) .cxx_destruct</code> methods will
be invoked immediately before the runtime deallocates an object instance.

     <p>As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.4 and later has
support for invoking the <code>- (id) .cxx_construct</code> and
<code>- (void) .cxx_destruct</code> methods.

     <br><dt><code>-fobjc-direct-dispatch</code><dd><a name="index-fobjc_002ddirect_002ddispatch-195"></a>Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher.  On Darwin this is
accomplished via the comm page.

     <br><dt><code>-fobjc-exceptions</code><dd><a name="index-fobjc_002dexceptions-196"></a>Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in Objective-C,
similar to what is offered by C++ and Java.  This option is
unavailable in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.2 and
earlier.

     <pre class="smallexample">            @try {
              ...
                 @throw expr;
              ...
            }
            @catch (AnObjCClass *exc) {
              ...
                @throw expr;
              ...
                @throw;
              ...
            }
            @catch (AnotherClass *exc) {
              ...
            }
            @catch (id allOthers) {
              ...
            }
            @finally {
              ...
                @throw expr;
              ...
            }
</pre>
     <p>The <code>@throw</code> statement may appear anywhere in an Objective-C or
Objective-C++ program; when used inside of a <code>@catch</code> block, the
<code>@throw</code> may appear without an argument (as shown above), in which case
the object caught by the <code>@catch</code> will be rethrown.

     <p>Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be thrown and
caught using this scheme.  When an object is thrown, it will be caught
by the nearest <code>@catch</code> clause capable of handling objects of that type,
analogously to how <code>catch</code> blocks work in C++ and Java.  A
<code>@catch(id ...)</code> clause (as shown above) may also be provided to catch
any and all Objective-C exceptions not caught by previous <code>@catch</code>
clauses (if any).

     <p>The <code>@finally</code> clause, if present, will be executed upon exit from the
immediately preceding <code>@try ... @catch</code> section.  This will happen
regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown, caught or rethrown
inside the <code>@try ... @catch</code> section, analogously to the behavior
of the <code>finally</code> clause in Java.

     <p>There are several caveats to using the new exception mechanism:

          <ul>
<li>Although currently designed to be binary compatible with <code>NS_HANDLER</code>-style
idioms provided by the <code>NSException</code> class, the new
exceptions can only be used on Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and later
systems, due to additional functionality needed in the (NeXT) Objective-C
runtime.

          <li>As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not support handling
types other than Objective-C objects.   Furthermore, when used from
Objective-C++, the Objective-C exception model does not interoperate with C++
exceptions at this time.  This means you cannot <code>@throw</code> an exception
from Objective-C and <code>catch</code> it in C++, or vice versa
(i.e., <code>throw ... @catch</code>). 
</ul>

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">-fobjc-exceptions</span></samp> switch also enables the use of synchronization
blocks for thread-safe execution:

     <pre class="smallexample">            @synchronized (ObjCClass *guard) {
              ...
            }
</pre>
     <p>Upon entering the <code>@synchronized</code> block, a thread of execution shall
first check whether a lock has been placed on the corresponding <code>guard</code>
object by another thread.  If it has, the current thread shall wait until
the other thread relinquishes its lock.  Once <code>guard</code> becomes available,
the current thread will place its own lock on it, execute the code contained in
the <code>@synchronized</code> block, and finally relinquish the lock (thereby
making <code>guard</code> available to other threads).

     <p>Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire methods to be marked
<code>@synchronized</code>.  Note that throwing exceptions out of
<code>@synchronized</code> blocks is allowed, and will cause the guarding object
to be unlocked properly.

     <br><dt><code>-fobjc-gc</code><dd><a name="index-fobjc_002dgc-197"></a>Enable garbage collection (GC) in Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs.

     <br><dt><code>-freplace-objc-classes</code><dd><a name="index-freplace_002dobjc_002dclasses-198"></a>Emit a special marker instructing <samp><span class="command">ld(1)</span></samp> not to statically link in
the resulting object file, and allow <samp><span class="command">dyld(1)</span></samp> to load it in at
run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Fix-and-Continue
debugging mode, where the object file in question may be recompiled and
dynamically reloaded in the course of program execution, without the need
to restart the program itself.  Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality
is only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.3
and later.

     <br><dt><code>-fzero-link</code><dd><a name="index-fzero_002dlink-199"></a>When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to <code>objc_getClass("...")</code> (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the <samp><span class="option">-fzero-link</span></samp> flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to <code>objc_getClass("...")</code>
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution.

     <br><dt><code>-gen-decls</code><dd><a name="index-gen_002ddecls-200"></a>Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file to a
file named <samp><var>sourcename</var><span class="file">.decl</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wassign-intercept </code><span class="roman">(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wassign_002dintercept-201"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dassign_002dintercept-202"></a>Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted by the
garbage collector.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-protocol </code><span class="roman">(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dprotocol-203"></a><a name="index-Wprotocol-204"></a>If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the <samp><span class="option">-Wno-protocol</span></samp> option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.

     <br><dt><code>-Wselector </code><span class="roman">(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wselector-205"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dselector-206"></a>Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a <code>@selector(...)</code>
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the <samp><span class="option">-fsyntax-only</span></samp> option is
being used.

     <br><dt><code>-Wstrict-selector-match </code><span class="roman">(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wstrict_002dselector_002dmatch-207"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dstrict_002dselector_002dmatch-208"></a>Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are
found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using this
selector to a receiver of type <code>id</code> or <code>Class</code>.  When this flag
is off (which is the default behavior), the compiler will omit such warnings
if any differences found are confined to types which share the same size
and alignment.

     <br><dt><code>-Wundeclared-selector </code><span class="roman">(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wundeclared_002dselector-209"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dundeclared_002dselector-210"></a>Warn if a <code>@selector(...)</code> expression referring to an
undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no
method with that name has been declared before the
<code>@selector(...)</code> expression, either explicitly in an
<code>@interface</code> or <code>@protocol</code> declaration, or implicitly in
an <code>@implementation</code> section.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a <code>@selector(...)</code> expression is found,
while <samp><span class="option">-Wselector</span></samp> only performs its checks in the final stage of
compilation.  This also enforces the coding style convention
that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.

     <br><dt><code>-print-objc-runtime-info</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dobjc_002druntime_002dinfo-211"></a>Generate C header describing the largest structure that is passed by
value, if any.
