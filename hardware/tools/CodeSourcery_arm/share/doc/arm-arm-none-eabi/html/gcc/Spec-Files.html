<h3 class="section">3.15 Specifying subprocesses and the switches to pass to them</h3>

<p><a name="index-Spec-Files-974"></a>
<samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> is a driver program.  It performs its job by invoking a
sequence of other programs to do the work of compiling, assembling and
linking.  GCC interprets its command-line parameters and uses these to
deduce which programs it should invoke, and which command-line options
it ought to place on their command lines.  This behavior is controlled
by <dfn>spec strings</dfn>.  In most cases there is one spec string for each
program that GCC can invoke, but a few programs have multiple spec
strings to control their behavior.  The spec strings built into GCC can
be overridden by using the <samp><span class="option">-specs=</span></samp> command-line switch to specify
a spec file.

 <p><dfn>Spec files</dfn> are plaintext files that are used to construct spec
strings.  They consist of a sequence of directives separated by blank
lines.  The type of directive is determined by the first non-whitespace
character on the line and it can be one of the following:

     <dl>
<dt><code>%</code><var>command</var><dd>Issues a <var>command</var> to the spec file processor.  The commands that can
appear here are:

          <dl>
<dt><code>%include &lt;</code><var>file</var><code>&gt;</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0025include-975"></a>Search for <var>file</var> and insert its text at the current point in the
specs file.

          <br><dt><code>%include_noerr &lt;</code><var>file</var><code>&gt;</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0025include_005fnoerr-976"></a>Just like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%include</span></samp>&rsquo;, but do not generate an error message if the include
file cannot be found.

          <br><dt><code>%rename </code><var>old_name</var> <var>new_name</var><dd><a name="index-g_t_0025rename-977"></a>Rename the spec string <var>old_name</var> to <var>new_name</var>.

     </dl>

     <br><dt><code>*[</code><var>spec_name</var><code>]:</code><dd>This tells the compiler to create, override or delete the named spec
string.  All lines after this directive up to the next directive or
blank line are considered to be the text for the spec string.  If this
results in an empty string then the spec will be deleted.  (Or, if the
spec did not exist, then nothing will happened.)  Otherwise, if the spec
does not currently exist a new spec will be created.  If the spec does
exist then its contents will be overridden by the text of this
directive, unless the first character of that text is the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;
character, in which case the text will be appended to the spec.

     <br><dt><code>[</code><var>suffix</var><code>]:</code><dd>Creates a new &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span><var>suffix</var><span class="samp">] spec</span></samp>&rsquo; pair.  All lines after this directive
and up to the next directive or blank line are considered to make up the
spec string for the indicated suffix.  When the compiler encounters an
input file with the named suffix, it will processes the spec string in
order to work out how to compile that file.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          .ZZ:
          z-compile -input %i
</pre>
     <p>This says that any input file whose name ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.ZZ</span></samp>&rsquo; should be
passed to the program &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z-compile</span></samp>&rsquo;, which should be invoked with the
command-line switch <samp><span class="option">-input</span></samp> and with the result of performing the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%i</span></samp>&rsquo; substitution.  (See below.)

     <p>As an alternative to providing a spec string, the text that follows a
suffix directive can be one of the following:

          <dl>
<dt><code>@</code><var>language</var><dd>This says that the suffix is an alias for a known <var>language</var>.  This is
similar to using the <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp> command-line switch to GCC to specify a
language explicitly.  For example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               .ZZ:
               @c++
</pre>
          <p>Says that .ZZ files are, in fact, C++ source files.

          <br><dt><code>#</code><var>name</var><dd>This causes an error messages saying:

          <pre class="smallexample">               <var>name</var> compiler not installed on this system.
</pre>
          </dl>

     <p>GCC already has an extensive list of suffixes built into it. 
This directive will add an entry to the end of the list of suffixes, but
since the list is searched from the end backwards, it is effectively
possible to override earlier entries using this technique.

 </dl>

 <p>GCC has the following spec strings built into it.  Spec files can
override these strings or create their own.  Note that individual
targets can also add their own spec strings to this list.

<pre class="smallexample">     asm          Options to pass to the assembler
     asm_final    Options to pass to the assembler post-processor
     cpp          Options to pass to the C preprocessor
     cc1          Options to pass to the C compiler
     cc1plus      Options to pass to the C++ compiler
     endfile      Object files to include at the end of the link
     link         Options to pass to the linker
     lib          Libraries to include on the command line to the linker
     libgcc       Decides which GCC support library to pass to the linker
     linker       Sets the name of the linker
     predefines   Defines to be passed to the C preprocessor
     signed_char  Defines to pass to CPP to say whether <code>char</code> is signed
                  by default
     startfile    Object files to include at the start of the link
</pre>
 <p>Here is a small example of a spec file:

<pre class="smallexample">     %rename lib                 old_lib
     
     *lib:
     --start-group -lgcc -lc -leval1 --end-group %(old_lib)
</pre>
 <p>This example renames the spec called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lib</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">old_lib</span></samp>&rsquo; and
then overrides the previous definition of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lib</span></samp>&rsquo; with a new one. 
The new definition adds in some extra command-line options before
including the text of the old definition.

 <p><dfn>Spec strings</dfn> are a list of command-line options to be passed to their
corresponding program.  In addition, the spec strings can contain
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;-prefixed sequences to substitute variable text or to
conditionally insert text into the command line.  Using these constructs
it is possible to generate quite complex command lines.

 <p>Here is a table of all defined &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;-sequences for spec
strings.  Note that spaces are not generated automatically around the
results of expanding these sequences.  Therefore you can concatenate them
together or combine them with constant text in a single argument.

     <dl>
<dt><code>%%</code><dd>Substitute one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; into the program name or argument.

     <br><dt><code>%i</code><dd>Substitute the name of the input file being processed.

     <br><dt><code>%b</code><dd>Substitute the basename of the input file being processed. 
This is the substring up to (and not including) the last period
and not including the directory.

     <br><dt><code>%B</code><dd>This is the same as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%b</span></samp>&rsquo;, but include the file suffix (text after
the last period).

     <br><dt><code>%d</code><dd>Marks the argument containing or following the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>&rsquo; as a
temporary file name, so that that file will be deleted if GCC exits
successfully.  Unlike &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>&rsquo;, this contributes no text to the
argument.

     <br><dt><code>%g</code><var>suffix</var><dd>Substitute a file name that has suffix <var>suffix</var> and is chosen
once per compilation, and mark the argument in the same way as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>&rsquo;.  To reduce exposure to denial-of-service attacks, the file
name is now chosen in a way that is hard to predict even when previously
chosen file names are known.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g.s ... %g.o ... %g.s</span></samp>&rsquo;
might turn into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ccUVUUAU.s ccXYAXZ12.o ccUVUUAU.s</span></samp>&rsquo;.  <var>suffix</var> matches
the regexp &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[.A-Za-z]*</span></samp>&rsquo; or the special string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%O</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is
treated exactly as if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%O</span></samp>&rsquo; had been preprocessed.  Previously, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>&rsquo;
was simply substituted with a file name chosen once per compilation,
without regard to any appended suffix (which was therefore treated
just like ordinary text), making such attacks more likely to succeed.

     <br><dt><code>%u</code><var>suffix</var><dd>Like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>&rsquo;, but generates a new temporary file name even if
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%u</span><var>suffix</var></samp>&rsquo; was already seen.

     <br><dt><code>%U</code><var>suffix</var><dd>Substitutes the last file name generated with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%u</span><var>suffix</var></samp>&rsquo;, generating a
new one if there is no such last file name.  In the absence of any
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%u</span><var>suffix</var></samp>&rsquo;, this is just like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g</span><var>suffix</var></samp>&rsquo;, except they don't share
the same suffix <em>space</em>, so &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g.s ... %U.s ... %g.s ... %U.s</span></samp>&rsquo;
would involve the generation of two distinct file names, one
for each &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g.s</span></samp>&rsquo; and another for each &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%U.s</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Previously, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%U</span></samp>&rsquo; was
simply substituted with a file name chosen for the previous &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%u</span></samp>&rsquo;,
without regard to any appended suffix.

     <br><dt><code>%j</code><var>suffix</var><dd>Substitutes the name of the <code>HOST_BIT_BUCKET</code>, if any, and if it is
writable, and if save-temps is off; otherwise, substitute the name
of a temporary file, just like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%u</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This temporary file is not
meant for communication between processes, but rather as a junk
disposal mechanism.

     <br><dt><code>%|</code><var>suffix</var><dt><code>%m</code><var>suffix</var><dd>Like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>&rsquo;, except if <samp><span class="option">-pipe</span></samp> is in effect.  In that case
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%|</span></samp>&rsquo; substitutes a single dash and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%m</span></samp>&rsquo; substitutes nothing at
all.  These are the two most common ways to instruct a program that it
should read from standard input or write to standard output.  If you
need something more elaborate you can use an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%{pipe:</span><code>X</code><span class="samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo;
construct: see for example <samp><span class="file">f/lang-specs.h</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>%.</code><var>SUFFIX</var><dd>Substitutes <var>.SUFFIX</var> for the suffixes of a matched switch's args
when it is subsequently output with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  <var>SUFFIX</var> is
terminated by the next space or %.

     <br><dt><code>%w</code><dd>Marks the argument containing or following the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%w</span></samp>&rsquo; as the
designated output file of this compilation.  This puts the argument
into the sequence of arguments that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%o</span></samp>&rsquo; will substitute later.

     <br><dt><code>%o</code><dd>Substitutes the names of all the output files, with spaces
automatically placed around them.  You should write spaces
around the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%o</span></samp>&rsquo; as well or the results are undefined. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%o</span></samp>&rsquo; is for use in the specs for running the linker. 
Input files whose names have no recognized suffix are not compiled
at all, but they are included among the output files, so they will
be linked.

     <br><dt><code>%O</code><dd>Substitutes the suffix for object files.  Note that this is
handled specially when it immediately follows &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g, %u, or %U</span></samp>&rsquo;,
because of the need for those to form complete file names.  The
handling is such that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%O</span></samp>&rsquo; is treated exactly as if it had already
been substituted, except that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g, %u, and %U</span></samp>&rsquo; do not currently
support additional <var>suffix</var> characters following &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%O</span></samp>&rsquo; as they would
following, for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>%p</code><dd>Substitutes the standard macro predefinitions for the
current target machine.  Use this when running <code>cpp</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%P</code><dd>Like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%p</span></samp>&rsquo;, but puts &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__</span></samp>&rsquo; before and after the name of each
predefined macro, except for macros that start with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__</span></samp>&rsquo; or with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span><var>L</var></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>L</var> is an uppercase letter.  This is for ISO
C.

     <br><dt><code>%I</code><dd>Substitute any of <samp><span class="option">-iprefix</span></samp> (made from <samp><span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span></samp>),
<samp><span class="option">-isysroot</span></samp> (made from <samp><span class="env">TARGET_SYSTEM_ROOT</span></samp>),
<samp><span class="option">-isystem</span></samp> (made from <samp><span class="env">COMPILER_PATH</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-B</span></samp> options)
and <samp><span class="option">-imultilib</span></samp> as necessary.

     <br><dt><code>%s</code><dd>Current argument is the name of a library or startup file of some sort. 
Search for that file in a standard list of directories and substitute
the full name found.  The current working directory is included in the
list of directories scanned.

     <br><dt><code>%T</code><dd>Current argument is the name of a linker script.  Search for that file
in the current list of directories to scan for libraries. If the file
is located insert a <samp><span class="option">--script</span></samp> option into the command line
followed by the full path name found.  If the file is not found then
generate an error message.  Note: the current working directory is not
searched.

     <br><dt><code>%e</code><var>str</var><dd>Print <var>str</var> as an error message.  <var>str</var> is terminated by a newline. 
Use this when inconsistent options are detected.

     <br><dt><code>%(</code><var>name</var><code>)</code><dd>Substitute the contents of spec string <var>name</var> at this point.

     <br><dt><code>%[</code><var>name</var><code>]</code><dd>Like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%(...)</span></samp>&rsquo; but put &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__</span></samp>&rsquo; around <samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp> arguments.

     <br><dt><code>%x{</code><var>option</var><code>}</code><dd>Accumulate an option for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%X</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>%X</code><dd>Output the accumulated linker options specified by <samp><span class="option">-Wl</span></samp> or a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%x</span></samp>&rsquo;
spec string.

     <br><dt><code>%Y</code><dd>Output the accumulated assembler options specified by <samp><span class="option">-Wa</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>%Z</code><dd>Output the accumulated preprocessor options specified by <samp><span class="option">-Wp</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>%a</code><dd>Process the <code>asm</code> spec.  This is used to compute the
switches to be passed to the assembler.

     <br><dt><code>%A</code><dd>Process the <code>asm_final</code> spec.  This is a spec string for
passing switches to an assembler post-processor, if such a program is
needed.

     <br><dt><code>%l</code><dd>Process the <code>link</code> spec.  This is the spec for computing the
command line passed to the linker.  Typically it will make use of the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%L %G %S %D and %E</span></samp>&rsquo; sequences.

     <br><dt><code>%D</code><dd>Dump out a <samp><span class="option">-L</span></samp> option for each directory that GCC believes might
contain startup files.  If the target supports multilibs then the
current multilib directory will be prepended to each of these paths.

     <br><dt><code>%L</code><dd>Process the <code>lib</code> spec.  This is a spec string for deciding which
libraries should be included on the command line to the linker.

     <br><dt><code>%G</code><dd>Process the <code>libgcc</code> spec.  This is a spec string for deciding
which GCC support library should be included on the command line to the linker.

     <br><dt><code>%S</code><dd>Process the <code>startfile</code> spec.  This is a spec for deciding which
object files should be the first ones passed to the linker.  Typically
this might be a file named <samp><span class="file">crt0.o</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>%E</code><dd>Process the <code>endfile</code> spec.  This is a spec string that specifies
the last object files that will be passed to the linker.

     <br><dt><code>%C</code><dd>Process the <code>cpp</code> spec.  This is used to construct the arguments
to be passed to the C preprocessor.

     <br><dt><code>%1</code><dd>Process the <code>cc1</code> spec.  This is used to construct the options to be
passed to the actual C compiler (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cc1</span></samp>&rsquo;).

     <br><dt><code>%2</code><dd>Process the <code>cc1plus</code> spec.  This is used to construct the options to be
passed to the actual C++ compiler (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cc1plus</span></samp>&rsquo;).

     <br><dt><code>%*</code><dd>Substitute the variable part of a matched option.  See below. 
Note that each comma in the substituted string is replaced by
a single space.

     <br><dt><code>%&lt;S</code><dd>Remove all occurrences of <code>-S</code> from the command line.  Note&mdash;this
command is position dependent.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; commands in the spec string
before this one will see <code>-S</code>, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; commands in the spec string
after this one will not.

     <br><dt><code>%:</code><var>function</var><code>(</code><var>args</var><code>)</code><dd>Call the named function <var>function</var>, passing it <var>args</var>. 
<var>args</var> is first processed as a nested spec string, then split
into an argument vector in the usual fashion.  The function returns
a string which is processed as if it had appeared literally as part
of the current spec.

     <p>The following built-in spec functions are provided:

          <dl>
<dt><code>getenv</code><dd>The <code>getenv</code> spec function takes two arguments: an environment
variable name and a string.  If the environment variable is not
defined, a fatal error is issued.  Otherwise, the return value is the
value of the environment variable concatenated with the string.  For
example, if <samp><span class="env">TOPDIR</span></samp> is defined as <samp><span class="file">/path/to/top</span></samp>, then:

          <pre class="smallexample">               %:getenv(TOPDIR /include)
</pre>
          <p>expands to <samp><span class="file">/path/to/top/include</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>if-exists</code><dd>The <code>if-exists</code> spec function takes one argument, an absolute
pathname to a file.  If the file exists, <code>if-exists</code> returns the
pathname.  Here is a small example of its usage:

          <pre class="smallexample">               *startfile:
               crt0%O%s %:if-exists(crti%O%s) crtbegin%O%s
</pre>
          <br><dt><code>if-exists-else</code><dd>The <code>if-exists-else</code> spec function is similar to the <code>if-exists</code>
spec function, except that it takes two arguments.  The first argument is
an absolute pathname to a file.  If the file exists, <code>if-exists-else</code>
returns the pathname.  If it does not exist, it returns the second argument. 
This way, <code>if-exists-else</code> can be used to select one file or another,
based on the existence of the first.  Here is a small example of its usage:

          <pre class="smallexample">               *startfile:
               crt0%O%s %:if-exists(crti%O%s) \
               %:if-exists-else(crtbeginT%O%s crtbegin%O%s)
</pre>
          <br><dt><code>replace-outfile</code><dd>The <code>replace-outfile</code> spec function takes two arguments.  It looks for the
first argument in the outfiles array and replaces it with the second argument.  Here
is a small example of its usage:

          <pre class="smallexample">               %{fgnu-runtime:%:replace-outfile(-lobjc -lobjc-gnu)}
</pre>
          <br><dt><code>print-asm-header</code><dd>The <code>print-asm-header</code> function takes no arguments and simply
prints a banner like:

          <pre class="smallexample">               Assembler options
               =================
               
               Use "-Wa,OPTION" to pass "OPTION" to the assembler.
</pre>
          <p>It is used to separate compiler options from assembler options
in the <samp><span class="option">--target-help</span></samp> output. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><code>%{S}</code><dd>Substitutes the <code>-S</code> switch, if that switch was given to GCC. 
If that switch was not specified, this substitutes nothing.  Note that
the leading dash is omitted when specifying this option, and it is
automatically inserted if the substitution is performed.  Thus the spec
string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%{foo}</span></samp>&rsquo; would match the command-line option <samp><span class="option">-foo</span></samp>
and would output the command line option <samp><span class="option">-foo</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>%W{S}</code><dd>Like %{<code>S</code>} but mark last argument supplied within as a file to be
deleted on failure.

     <br><dt><code>%{S*}</code><dd>Substitutes all the switches specified to GCC whose names start
with <code>-S</code>, but which also take an argument.  This is used for
switches like <samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp>, etc. 
GCC considers <samp><span class="option">-o foo</span></samp> as being
one switch whose names starts with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo;.  %{o*} would substitute this
text, including the space.  Thus two arguments would be generated.

     <br><dt><code>%{S*&amp;T*}</code><dd>Like %{<code>S</code>*}, but preserve order of <code>S</code> and <code>T</code> options
(the order of <code>S</code> and <code>T</code> in the spec is not significant). 
There can be any number of ampersand-separated variables; for each the
wild card is optional.  Useful for CPP as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%{D*&amp;U*&amp;A*}</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>%{S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-S</span></samp>&rsquo; switch was given to GCC.

     <br><dt><code>%{!S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-S</span></samp>&rsquo; switch was <em>not</em> given to GCC.

     <br><dt><code>%{S*:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code> if one or more switches whose names start with
<code>-S</code> are specified to GCC.  Normally <code>X</code> is substituted only
once, no matter how many such switches appeared.  However, if <code>%*</code>
appears somewhere in <code>X</code>, then <code>X</code> will be substituted once
for each matching switch, with the <code>%*</code> replaced by the part of
that switch that matched the <code>*</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%{.S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, if processing a file with suffix <code>S</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%{!.S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, if <em>not</em> processing a file with suffix <code>S</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%{,S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, if processing a file for language <code>S</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%{!,S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, if not processing a file for language <code>S</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%{S|P:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code> if either <code>-S</code> or <code>-P</code> was given to
GCC.  This may be combined with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
<code>*</code> sequences as well, although they have a stronger binding than
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If <code>%*</code> appears in <code>X</code>, all of the
alternatives must be starred, and only the first matching alternative
is substituted.

     <p>For example, a spec string like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          %{.c:-foo} %{!.c:-bar} %{.c|d:-baz} %{!.c|d:-boggle}
</pre>
     <p>will output the following command-line options from the following input
command-line options:

     <pre class="smallexample">          fred.c        -foo -baz
          jim.d         -bar -boggle
          -d fred.c     -foo -baz -boggle
          -d jim.d      -bar -baz -boggle
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>%{S:X; T:Y; :D}</code><dd>
If <code>S</code> was given to GCC, substitutes <code>X</code>; else if <code>T</code> was
given to GCC, substitutes <code>Y</code>; else substitutes <code>D</code>.  There can
be as many clauses as you need.  This may be combined with <code>.</code>,
<code>,</code>, <code>!</code>, <code>|</code>, and <code>*</code> as needed.

     <br><dt><code>-mlow-irq-latency</code><dd><a name="index-mlow_002dirq_002dlatency-978"></a>Avoid instructions with high interrupt latency when generating
code.  This can increase code size and reduce performance. 
The option is off by default.

 </dl>

 <p>The conditional text <code>X</code> in a %{<code>S</code>:<code>X</code>} or similar
construct may contain other nested &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; constructs or spaces, or
even newlines.  They are processed as usual, as described above. 
Trailing white space in <code>X</code> is ignored.  White space may also
appear anywhere on the left side of the colon in these constructs,
except between <code>.</code> or <code>*</code> and the corresponding word.

 <p>The <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-m</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="option">-W</span></samp> switches are
handled specifically in these constructs.  If another value of
<samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> or the negated form of a <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-m</span></samp>, or
<samp><span class="option">-W</span></samp> switch is found later in the command line, the earlier
switch value is ignored, except with {<code>S</code>*} where <code>S</code> is
just one letter, which passes all matching options.

 <p>The character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo; at the beginning of the predicate text is used to
indicate that a command should be piped to the following command, but
only if <samp><span class="option">-pipe</span></samp> is specified.

 <p>It is built into GCC which switches take arguments and which do not. 
(You might think it would be useful to generalize this to allow each
compiler's spec to say which switches take arguments.  But this cannot
be done in a consistent fashion.  GCC cannot even decide which input
files have been specified without knowing which switches take arguments,
and it must know which input files to compile in order to tell which
compilers to run).

 <p>GCC also knows implicitly that arguments starting in <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> are to be
treated as compiler output files, and passed to the linker in their
proper position among the other output files.
