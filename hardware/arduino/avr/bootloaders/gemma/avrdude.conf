# AVRDUDE Configuration File
#
# This file contains configuration data used by AVRDUDE which describes
# the programming hardware pinouts and also provides part definitions.
# AVRDUDE's "-C" command line option specifies the location of the
# configuration file.  The "-c" option names the programmer configuration
# which must match one of the entry's "id" parameter.  The "-p" option
# identifies which part AVRDUDE is going to be programming and must match
# one of the parts' "id" parameter.
#
# Possible entry formats are:
#
#   programmer
#       parent <id>                                 # optional parent

# string values override parameter values from the parent part. New

#
# NOTES:
#   * 'devicecode' is the device code used by the STK500 (see codes 
#       listed below)
#   * Not all memory types will implement all instructions.
#   * AVR Fuse bits and Lock bits are implemented as a type of memory.
#   * Example memory types are:
#       "flash", "eeprom", "fuse", "lfuse" (low fuse), "hfuse" (high
#       fuse), "signature", "calibration", "lock"
#   * The memory type specified on the avrdude command line must match
#     one of the memory types defined for the specified chip.
#   * The pwroff_after_write flag causes avrdude to attempt to
#     power the device off and back on after an unsuccessful write to
#     the affected memory area if VCC programmer pins are defined.  If
#     VCC pins are not defined for the programmer, a message
#     indicating that the device needs a power-cycle is printed out.
#     This flag was added to work around a problem with the
#     at90s4433/2333's; see the at90s4433 errata at:
#
#         http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc1280.pdf
#
# INSTRUCTION FORMATS
#
#    Instruction formats are specified as a comma seperated list of
#    string values containing information (bit specifiers) about each
#    of the 32 bits of the instruction.  Bit specifiers may be one of
#    the following formats:
#
#       '1'  = the bit is always set on input as well as output
#
#       '0'  = the bit is always clear on input as well as output
#
#       'x'  = the bit is ignored on input and output
#
#       'a'  = the bit is an address bit, the bit-number matches this bit
#              specifier's position within the current instruction byte
#
#       'aN' = the bit is the Nth address bit, bit-number = N, i.e., a12
#              is address bit 12 on input, a0 is address bit 0.
#
#       'i'  = the bit is an input data bit
#
#       'o'  = the bit is an output data bit
#
#    Each instruction must be composed of 32 bit specifiers.  The
#    instruction specification closely follows the instruction data
#    provided in Atmel's data sheets for their parts.
#
# See below for some examples.
#
#
# The following are STK500 part device codes to use for the
# "devicecode" field of the part.  These came from Atmel's software
# section avr061.zip which accompanies the application note
# AVR061 available from:
