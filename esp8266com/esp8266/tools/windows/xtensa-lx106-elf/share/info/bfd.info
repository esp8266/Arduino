1 Introduction
**************

BFD is a package which allows applications to use the same routines to
operate on object files whatever the object file format.  A new object
file format can be supported simply by creating a new BFD back end and
adding it to the library.

   BFD is split into two parts: the front end, and the back ends (one
for each object file format).
   * The front end of BFD provides the interface to the user. It manages
     memory and various canonical data structures. The front end also
     decides which back end to use and when to call back end routines.

   * The back ends provide BFD its view of the real world. Each back
     end provides a set of calls which the BFD front end can use to
     maintain its canonical form. The back ends also may keep around
     information for their own use, for greater efficiency.

1.1 History
===========

One spur behind BFD was the desire, on the part of the GNU 960 team at
Intel Oregon, for interoperability of applications on their COFF and
b.out file formats.  Cygnus was providing GNU support for the team, and
was contracted to provide the required functionality.

   The name came from a conversation David Wallace was having with
Richard Stallman about the library: RMS said that it would be quite
hard--David said "BFD".  Stallman was right, but the name stuck.

   At the same time, Ready Systems wanted much the same thing, but for
different object file formats: IEEE-695, Oasys, Srecords, a.out and 68k
coff.

   BFD was first implemented by members of Cygnus Support; Steve
Chamberlain (`sac@cygnus.com'), John Gilmore (`gnu@cygnus.com'), K.
Richard Pixley (`rich@cygnus.com') and David Henkel-Wallace
(`gumby@cygnus.com').

1.2 How To Use BFD
==================

To use the library, include `bfd.h' and link with `libbfd.a'.

   BFD provides a common interface to the parts of an object file for a
calling application.

   When an application successfully opens a target file (object,
archive, or whatever), a pointer to an internal structure is returned.
This pointer points to a structure called `bfd', described in `bfd.h'.
Our convention is to call this pointer a BFD, and instances of it
within code `abfd'.  All operations on the target object file are
applied as methods to the BFD.  The mapping is defined within `bfd.h'
in a set of macros, all beginning with `bfd_' to reduce namespace
pollution.

   For example, this sequence does what you would probably expect:
return the number of sections in an object file attached to a BFD
`abfd'.

     #include "bfd.h"

     unsigned int number_of_sections (abfd)
     bfd *abfd;
     {
       return bfd_count_sections (abfd);
     }

   The abstraction used within BFD is that an object file has:

   * a header,

   * a number of sections containing raw data (*note Sections::),

   * a set of relocations (*note Relocations::), and

   * some symbol information (*note Symbols::).
   Also, BFDs opened for archives have the additional attribute of an
index and contain subordinate BFDs. This approach is fine for a.out and
coff, but loses efficiency when applied to formats such as S-records and
IEEE-695.

1.3 What BFD Version 2 Can Do
=============================

When an object file is opened, BFD subroutines automatically determine
the format of the input object file.  They then build a descriptor in
memory with pointers to routines that will be used to access elements of
the object file's data structures.

   As different information from the object files is required, BFD
reads from different sections of the file and processes them.  For
example, a very common operation for the linker is processing symbol
tables.  Each BFD back end provides a routine for converting between
the object file's representation of symbols and an internal canonical
format. When the linker asks for the symbol table of an object file, it
calls through a memory pointer to the routine from the relevant BFD
back end which reads and converts the table into a canonical form.  The
linker then operates upon the canonical form. When the link is finished
and the linker writes the output file's symbol table, another BFD back
end routine is called to take the newly created symbol table and
convert it into the chosen output format.

File: bfd.info,  Node: BFD information loss,  Next: Canonical format,  Up: What BFD Version 2 Can Do

1.3.1 Information Loss
----------------------

_Information can be lost during output._ The output formats supported
by BFD do not provide identical facilities, and information which can
be described in one form has nowhere to go in another format. One
example of this is alignment information in `b.out'. There is nowhere
in an `a.out' format file to store alignment information on the
contained data, so when a file is linked from `b.out' and an `a.out'
image is produced, alignment information will not propagate to the
output file. (The linker will still use the alignment information
internally, so the link is performed correctly).

   Another example is COFF section names. COFF files may contain an
unlimited number of sections, each one with a textual section name. If
the target of the link is a format which does not have many sections
(e.g., `a.out') or has sections without names (e.g., the Oasys format),
the link cannot be done simply. You can circumvent this problem by
describing the desired input-to-output section mapping with the linker
command language.

   _Information can be lost during canonicalization._ The BFD internal
canonical form of the external formats is not exhaustive; there are
structures in input formats for which there is no direct representation
internally.  This means that the BFD back ends cannot maintain all
possible data richness through the transformation between external to
internal and back to external formats.

   This limitation is only a problem when an application reads one
format and writes another.  Each BFD back end is responsible for
maintaining as much data as possible, and the internal BFD canonical
form has structures which are opaque to the BFD core, and exported only
to the back ends. When a file is read in one format, the canonical form
is generated for BFD and the application. At the same time, the back
end saves away any information which may otherwise be lost. If the data
is then written back in the same format, the back end routine will be
able to use the canonical form provided by the BFD core as well as the
information it prepared earlier.  Since there is a great deal of
commonality between back ends, there is no information lost when
linking or copying big endian COFF to little endian COFF, or `a.out' to
`b.out'.  When a mixture of formats is linked, the information is only
lost from the files whose format differs from the destination.

1.3.2 The BFD canonical object-file format
------------------------------------------

The greatest potential for loss of information occurs when there is the
least overlap between the information provided by the source format,
that stored by the canonical format, and that needed by the destination
format. A brief description of the canonical form may help you
understand which kinds of data you can count on preserving across
conversions.  

_files_
     Information stored on a per-file basis includes target machine
     architecture, particular implementation format type, a demand
     pageable bit, and a write protected bit.  Information like Unix
     magic numbers is not stored here--only the magic numbers' meaning,
     so a `ZMAGIC' file would have both the demand pageable bit and the
     write protected text bit set.  The byte order of the target is
     stored on a per-file basis, so that big- and little-endian object
     files may be used with one another.

_sections_
     Each section in the input file contains the name of the section,
     the section's original address in the object file, size and
     alignment information, various flags, and pointers into other BFD
     data structures.

_symbols_
     Each symbol contains a pointer to the information for the object
     file which originally defined it, its name, its value, and various
     flag bits.  When a BFD back end reads in a symbol table, it
     relocates all symbols to make them relative to the base of the
     section where they were defined.  Doing this ensures that each
     symbol points to its containing section.  Each symbol also has a
     varying amount of hidden private data for the BFD back end.  Since
     the symbol points to the original file, the private data format
     for that symbol is accessible.  `ld' can operate on a collection
     of symbols of wildly different formats without problems.

     Normal global and simple local symbols are maintained on output,
     so an output file (no matter its format) will retain symbols
     pointing to functions and to global, static, and common variables.
     Some symbol information is not worth retaining; in `a.out', type
     information is stored in the symbol table as long symbol names.
     This information would be useless to most COFF debuggers; the
     linker has command line switches to allow users to throw it away.

     There is one word of type information within the symbol, so if the
     format supports symbol type information within symbols (for
     example, COFF, IEEE, Oasys) and the type is simple enough to fit
     within one word (nearly everything but aggregates), the
     information will be preserved.

_relocation level_
     Each canonical BFD relocation record contains a pointer to the
     symbol to relocate to, the offset of the data to relocate, the
     section the data is in, and a pointer to a relocation type
     descriptor. Relocation is performed by passing messages through
     the relocation type descriptor and the symbol pointer. Therefore,
     relocations can be performed on output data using a relocation
     method that is only available in one of the input formats. For
     instance, Oasys provides a byte relocation format.  A relocation
     record requesting this relocation type would point indirectly to a
     routine to perform this, so the relocation may be performed on a
     byte being written to a 68k COFF file, even though 68k COFF has no
     such relocation type.

_line numbers_
     Object formats can contain, for debugging purposes, some form of
     mapping between symbols, source line numbers, and addresses in the
     output file.  These addresses have to be relocated along with the
     symbol information.  Each symbol with an associated list of line
     number records points to the first record of the list.  The head
     of a line number list consists of a pointer to the symbol, which
     allows finding out the address of the function whose line number
     is being described. The rest of the list is made up of pairs:
     offsets into the section and line numbers. Any format which can
     simply derive this information can pass it successfully between
     formats (COFF, IEEE and Oasys).

2.2 Error reporting
===================

Most BFD functions return nonzero on success (check their individual
documentation for precise semantics).  On an error, they call
`bfd_set_error' to set an error condition that callers can check by
calling `bfd_get_error'. If that returns `bfd_error_system_call',
then check `errno'.  The easiest way to report a BFD error to the
user is to use `bfd_perror'. 

2.2.1 Type `bfd_error_type'
---------------------------

The values returned by `bfd_get_error' are defined by the enumerated
type `bfd_error_type'.  
     
     typedef enum bfd_error
     {
       bfd_error_no_error = 0,
       bfd_error_system_call,
       bfd_error_invalid_target,
       bfd_error_wrong_format,
       bfd_error_wrong_object_format,
       bfd_error_invalid_operation,
       bfd_error_no_memory,
       bfd_error_no_symbols,
       bfd_error_no_armap,
       bfd_error_no_more_archived_files,
       bfd_error_malformed_archive,
       bfd_error_missing_dso,
       bfd_error_file_not_recognized,
       bfd_error_file_ambiguously_recognized,
       bfd_error_no_contents,
       bfd_error_nonrepresentable_section,
       bfd_error_no_debug_section,
       bfd_error_bad_value,
       bfd_error_file_truncated,
       bfd_error_file_too_big,
       bfd_error_on_input,
       bfd_error_invalid_error_code
     }
     bfd_error_type;
     
   
2.2.1.1 `bfd_get_error'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_error_type bfd_get_error (void);
   *Description*
 Return the current BFD error condition.  

2.2.1.2 `bfd_set_error'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_error (bfd_error_type error_tag, ...);
   *Description*
 Set the BFD error condition to be ERROR_TAG. If ERROR_TAG is
bfd_error_on_input, then this function takes two more parameters, the
input bfd where the error occurred, and the bfd_error_type error.  

2.2.1.3 `bfd_errmsg'
....................

*Synopsis*
     const char *bfd_errmsg (bfd_error_type error_tag);
   *Description*
 Return a string describing the error ERROR_TAG, or the system
error if ERROR_TAG is `bfd_error_system_call'.  

2.2.1.4 `bfd_perror'
....................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_perror (const char *message);
   *Description*
 Print to the standard error stream a string describing the last
BFD error that occurred, or the last system error if the last BFD
error was a system call failure.  If MESSAGE is non-NULL and
non-empty, the error string printed is preceded by MESSAGE, a colon,
and a space.  It is followed by a newline. 

2.2.2 BFD error handler
-----------------------

Some BFD functions want to print messages describing the problem.
They call a BFD error handler function.  This function may be
overridden by the program.  The BFD error handler acts like
printf.  
     
     typedef void (*bfd_error_handler_type) (const char *, ...);
     
   
2.2.2.1 `bfd_set_error_handler'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_error_handler_type bfd_set_error_handler (bfd_error_handler_type);
   *Description*
 Set the BFD error handler function.  Returns the previous
function.  

2.2.2.2 `bfd_set_error_program_name'
....................................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_error_program_name (const char *);
   *Description*
 Set the program name to use when printing a BFD error.  This is
printed before the error message followed by a colon and space.  The
string must not be changed after it is passed to this function.  

2.2.2.3 `bfd_get_error_handler'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_error_handler_type bfd_get_error_handler (void);
   *Description*
 Return the BFD error handler function. 

2.2.3 BFD assert handler
------------------------

If BFD finds an internal inconsistency, the bfd assert handler is
called with information on the BFD version, BFD source file and line.
If this happens, most programs linked against BFD are expected to
want to exit with an error, or mark the current BFD operation as
failed, so it is recommended to override the default handler, which
just calls _bfd_error_handler and continues.  
     
     typedef void (*bfd_assert_handler_type) (const char *bfd_formatmsg,
                                              const char *bfd_version,
                                              const char *bfd_file,
                                              int bfd_line);

2.3 Miscellaneous
=================

 

2.3.1 Miscellaneous functions
-----------------------------

  

2.3.1.1 `bfd_get_reloc_upper_bound'
...................................

*Synopsis*
     long bfd_get_reloc_upper_bound (bfd *abfd, asection *sect);
   *Description*
 Return the number of bytes required to store the relocation
information associated with section SECT attached to bfd ABFD.  If an
error occurs, return -1.  

2.3.1.2 `bfd_canonicalize_reloc'
................................

*Synopsis*
     long bfd_canonicalize_reloc
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, arelent **loc, asymbol **syms);
   *Description*
 Call the back end associated with the open BFD ABFD and translate
the external form of the relocation information attached to SEC into
the internal canonical form.  Place the table into memory at LOC,
which has been preallocated, usually by a call to
`bfd_get_reloc_upper_bound'.  Returns the number of relocs, or -1 on
error.  The SYMS table is also needed for horrible internal magic
reasons.  

2.3.1.3 `bfd_set_reloc'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_reloc
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, arelent **rel, unsigned int count);
   *Description*
 Set the relocation pointer and count within section SEC to the
values REL and COUNT. The argument ABFD is ignored.  

2.3.1.4 `bfd_set_file_flags'
............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_file_flags (bfd *abfd, flagword flags);
   *Description*
 Set the flag word in the BFD ABFD to the value FLAGS.  Possible
errors are:
     

   * `bfd_error_wrong_format' - The target bfd was not of object
     format.

   * `bfd_error_invalid_operation' - The target bfd was open for
     reading.

   * `bfd_error_invalid_operation' - The flag word contained a bit
     which was not applicable to the type of file.  E.g., an attempt
     was made to set the `D_PAGED' bit on a BFD format which does not
     support demand paging.
    

2.3.1.5 `bfd_get_arch_size'
...........................

*Synopsis*
     int bfd_get_arch_size (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
 Returns the architecture address size, in bits, as determined by
the object file's format.  For ELF, this information is included in
the header.  *Returns*
 Returns the arch size in bits if known, `-1' otherwise.  

2.3.1.6 `bfd_get_sign_extend_vma'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     int bfd_get_sign_extend_vma (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
 Indicates if the target architecture "naturally" sign extends an
address.  Some architectures implicitly sign extend address values
when they are converted to types larger than the size of an address.
For instance, bfd_get_start_address() will return an address sign
extended to fill a bfd_vma when this is the case.  *Returns*
 Returns `1' if the target architecture is known to sign extend
addresses, `0' if the target architecture is known to not sign extend
addresses, and `-1' otherwise.  

2.3.1.7 `bfd_set_start_address'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_start_address (bfd *abfd, bfd_vma vma);
   *Description*
 Make VMA the entry point of output BFD ABFD.  *Returns*
 Returns `TRUE' on success, `FALSE' otherwise.  

2.3.1.8 `bfd_get_gp_size'
.........................

*Synopsis*
     unsigned int bfd_get_gp_size (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
 Return the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP
register under MIPS ECOFF.  This is typically set by the `-G'
argument to the compiler, assembler or linker.  

2.3.1.9 `bfd_set_gp_size'
.........................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_gp_size (bfd *abfd, unsigned int i);
   *Description*
 Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP
register under ECOFF or MIPS ELF.  This is typically set by the `-G'
argument to the compiler, assembler or linker.  

2.3.1.10 `bfd_scan_vma'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_vma bfd_scan_vma (const char *string, const char **end, int base);
   *Description*
 Convert, like `strtoul', a numerical expression STRING into a
`bfd_vma' integer, and return that integer. (Though without as many
bells and whistles as `strtoul'.) The expression is assumed to be
unsigned (i.e., positive). If given a BASE, it is used as the base
for conversion. A base of 0 causes the function to interpret the
string in hex if a leading "0x" or "0X" is found, otherwise in
octal if a leading zero is found, otherwise in decimal.  If the
value would overflow, the maximum `bfd_vma' value is returned.  

2.3.1.11 `bfd_copy_private_header_data'
.......................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_copy_private_header_data (bfd *ibfd, bfd *obfd);

no-op for other formats.  

2.3.1.21 `bfd_demangle'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     char *bfd_demangle (bfd *, const char *, int);
   *Description*
 Wrapper around cplus_demangle.  Strips leading underscores and
other such chars that would otherwise confuse the demangler. If
passed a g++ v3 ABI mangled name, returns a buffer allocated with
malloc holding the demangled name.  Returns NULL otherwise and on
memory alloc failure. 

2.3.1.22 `struct bfd_iovec'

*Description*
 The `struct bfd_iovec' contains the internal file I/O class. Each
`BFD' has an instance of this class and all file I/O is routed
through it (it is assumed that the instance implements all methods
listed below).
     struct bfd_iovec
     {
       /* To avoid problems with macros, a "b" rather than "f"
          prefix is prepended to each method name.  */

          bytes starting at PTR.  Return the number of bytes actually
          transfered (a read past end-of-file returns less than NBYTES),
          or -1 (setting `bfd_error') if an error occurs.  */

          if an error occurs.  */

          Also write in MAP_ADDR the address of the page aligned buffer and in
          MAP_LEN the size mapped (a page multiple).  Use unmap with MAP_ADDR and
          MAP_LEN to unmap.  */

2.3.1.23 `bfd_get_mtime'
........................

*Synopsis*
     long bfd_get_mtime (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
 Return the file modification time (as read from the file system, or
from the archive header for archive members).  

2.3.1.24 `bfd_get_size'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     file_ptr bfd_get_size (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
 Return the file size (as read from file system) for the file
associated with BFD ABFD.  The initial motivation for, and use of,
this routine is not so we can get the exact size of the object the
BFD applies to, since that might not be generally possible (archive
members for example). It would be ideal if someone could eventually
modify it so that such results were guaranteed.  Instead, we want
to ask questions like "is this NNN byte sized object I'm about to try
read from file offset YYY reasonable?" As as example of where we
might do this, some object formats use string tables for which the
first `sizeof (long)' bytes of the table contain the size of the
table itself, including the size bytes. If an application tries to
read what it thinks is one of these string tables, without some way
to validate the size, and for some reason the size is wrong (byte
swapping error, wrong location for the string table, etc.), the only
clue is likely to be a read error when it tries to read the table, or
a "virtual memory exhausted" error when it tries to allocate 15
bazillon bytes of space for the 15 bazillon byte table it is about to
read. This function at least allows us to answer the question, "is
the size reasonable?".  

2.3.1.25 `bfd_mmap'
...................

*Synopsis*
     void *bfd_mmap (bfd *abfd, void *addr, bfd_size_type len,
         int prot, int flags, file_ptr offset,
         void **map_addr, bfd_size_type *map_len);
   *Description*
 Return mmap()ed region of the file, if possible and implemented.
LEN and OFFSET do not need to be page aligned.  The page aligned
address and length are written to MAP_ADDR and MAP_LEN.

2.4 Memory Usage
================

BFD keeps all of its internal structures in obstacks. There is one
obstack per open BFD file, into which the current state is stored. When
a BFD is closed, the obstack is deleted, and so everything which has
been allocated by BFD for the closing file is thrown away.

   BFD does not free anything created by an application, but pointers
into `bfd' structures become invalid on a `bfd_close'; for example,
after a `bfd_close' the vector passed to `bfd_canonicalize_symtab' is
still around, since it has been allocated by the application, but the
data that it pointed to are lost.

   The general rule is to not close a BFD until all operations dependent
upon data from the BFD have been completed, or all the data from within
the file has been copied. To help with the management of memory, there
is a function (`bfd_alloc_size') which returns the number of bytes in
obstacks associated with the supplied BFD. This could be used to select
the greediest open BFD, close it to reclaim the memory, perform some
operation and reopen the BFD again, to get a fresh copy of the data
structures.

2.5 Initialization
==================

 

2.5.1 Initialization functions
------------------------------

These are the functions that handle initializing a BFD.  

2.5.1.1 `bfd_init'
..................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_init (void);
   *Description*
 This routine must be called before any other BFD function to
initialize magical internal data structures. 


File: bfd.info,  Node: Sections,  Next: Symbols,  Prev: Initialization,  Up: BFD front end

2.6 Sections
============

The raw data contained within a BFD is maintained through the section
abstraction.  A single BFD may have any number of sections.  It keeps
hold of them by pointing to the first; each one points to the next in
the list.  Sections are supported in BFD in `section.c'. 

* Menu:

* Section Input::
* Section Output::
* typedef asection::
* section prototypes::
   


File: bfd.info,  Node: Section Input,  Next: Section Output,  Prev: Sections,  Up: Sections

2.6.1 Section input
-------------------

When a BFD is opened for reading, the section structures are created
and attached to the BFD.  Each section has a name which describes
the section in the outside world--for example, `a.out' would contain
at least three sections, called `.text', `.data' and `.bss'. 
Names need not be unique; for example a COFF file may have several
sections named `.data'.  Sometimes a BFD will contain more than the
"natural" number of sections. A back end may attach other sections
containing constructor data, or an application may add a section
(using `bfd_make_section') to the sections attached to an already
open BFD. For example, the linker creates an extra section `COMMON'
for each input file's BFD to hold information about common storage.
 The raw data is not necessarily read in when the section
descriptor is created. Some targets may leave the data in place until
a `bfd_get_section_contents' call is made. Other back ends may read
in all the data at once.  For example, an S-record file has to be
read once to determine the size of the data. An IEEE-695 file doesn't
contain raw data in sections, but data and relocation expressions
intermixed, so the data area has to be parsed to get out the data
and relocations. 


File: bfd.info,  Node: Section Output,  Next: typedef asection,  Prev: Section Input,  Up: Sections

2.6.2 Section output
--------------------

To write a new object style BFD, the various sections to be written
have to be created. They are attached to the BFD in the same way as
input sections; data is written to the sections using
`bfd_set_section_contents'.  Any program that creates or combines
sections (e.g., the assembler and linker) must use the `asection'
fields `output_section' and `output_offset' to indicate the file
sections to which each section must be written.  (If the section is
being created from scratch, `output_section' should probably point to
the section itself and `output_offset' should probably be zero.) 
The data to be written comes from input sections attached (via
`output_section' pointers) to the output sections.  The output
section structure can be considered a filter for the input section:
the output section determines the vma of the output data and the
name, but the input section determines the offset into the output
section of the data to be written.  E.g., to create a section
"O", starting at 0x100, 0x123 long, containing two subsections, "A"
at offset 0x0 (i.e., at vma 0x100) and "B" at offset 0x20 (i.e., at
vma 0x120) the `asection' structures would look like: 
        section name          "A"
          output_offset   0x00
          size            0x20
          output_section ----------->  section name    "O"
                                  |    vma             0x100
        section name          "B" |    size            0x123
          output_offset   0x20    |
          size            0x103   |
          output_section  --------|
   

2.6.3 Link orders
-----------------

The data within a section is stored in a "link_order". These are much
like the fixups in `gas'.  The link_order abstraction allows a
section to grow and shrink within itself.  A link_order knows how
big it is, and which is the next link_order and where the raw data
for it is; it also points to a list of relocations which apply to
it.  The link_order is used by the linker to perform relaxing on
final code.  The compiler creates code which is as big as necessary
to make it work without relaxing, and the user can select whether to
relax.  Sometimes relaxing takes a lot of time.  The linker runs
around the relocations to see if any are attached to data which can
be shrunk, if so it does it on a link_order by link_order basis.

   *Description*
 Create a new empty section called NAME and attach it to the end of
the chain of sections for the BFD ABFD. An attempt to create a
section with a name which is already in use returns its pointer
without changing the section chain.  It has the funny name since
this is the way it used to be before it was rewritten.... 
Possible errors are:

        (bfd *, const char *name, flagword flags);
   *Description*
 Like `bfd_make_section_anyway', but return `NULL' (without calling
bfd_set_error ()) without changing the section chain if there is
already a section named NAME.  Also set the attributes of the new

set `bfd_error'.  

2.6.5.11 `bfd_make_section'
...........................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_make_section (bfd *, const char *name);
   *Description*
 Like `bfd_make_section_anyway', but return `NULL' (without calling
bfd_set_error ()) without changing the section chain if there is
already a section named NAME.  If there is an error, return `NULL'
and set `bfd_error'.  

2.6.5.12 `bfd_set_section_flags'
................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_section_flags
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, flagword flags);
   *Description*
 Set the attributes of the section SEC in the BFD ABFD to the value
FLAGS. Return `TRUE' on success, `FALSE' on error. Possible error
returns are: 
     

   * `bfd_error_invalid_operation' - The section cannot have one or
     more of the attributes requested. For example, a .bss section in
     `a.out' may not have the `SEC_HAS_CONTENTS' field set.

 Call the provided function FUNC for each section attached to the
BFD ABFD, passing OBJ as an argument. The function will be called as
if by 
            func (abfd, the_section, obj);
    This is the preferred method for iterating over sections; an
alternative would be to use a loop: 
               asection *p;
               for (p = abfd->sections; p != NULL; p = p->next)
                  func (abfd, p, ...)

         bfd_boolean (*operation) (bfd *abfd, asection *sect, void *obj),
         void *obj);
   *Description*
 Call the provided function OPERATION for each section attached to
the BFD ABFD, passing OBJ as an argument. The function will be called
as if by

     bfd_boolean bfd_set_section_size
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, bfd_size_type val);
   *Description*
 Set SEC to the size VAL. If the operation is ok, then `TRUE' is
returned, else `FALSE'.  Possible error returns:
     

   * `bfd_error_invalid_operation' - Writing has started to the BFD,
     so setting the size is invalid.
    

2.6.5.17 `bfd_set_section_contents'
...................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_section_contents
        (bfd *abfd, asection *section, const void *data,
         file_ptr offset, bfd_size_type count);
   *Description*
 Sets the contents of the section SECTION in BFD ABFD to the data
starting in memory at DATA. The data is written to the output section
starting at offset OFFSET for COUNT octets.  Normally `TRUE' is
returned, else `FALSE'. Possible error returns are:
     

   * `bfd_error_no_contents' - The output section does not have the
     `SEC_HAS_CONTENTS' attribute, so nothing can be written to it.

   * and some more too
   This routine is front end to the back end function
`_bfd_set_section_contents'.  

2.6.5.18 `bfd_get_section_contents'

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_get_section_contents
        (bfd *abfd, asection *section, void *location, file_ptr offset,
         bfd_size_type count);
   *Description*
 Read data from SECTION in BFD ABFD into memory starting at
LOCATION. The data is read at an offset of OFFSET from the start of
the input section, and is read for COUNT bytes.  If the contents
of a constructor with the `SEC_CONSTRUCTOR' flag set are requested or
if the section does not have the `SEC_HAS_CONTENTS' flag set, then
the LOCATION is filled with zeroes. If no errors occur, `TRUE' is
returned, else `FALSE'.  

2.6.5.19 `bfd_malloc_and_get_section'
.....................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_malloc_and_get_section
        (bfd *abfd, asection *section, bfd_byte **buf);
   *Description*
 Read all data from SECTION in BFD ABFD into a buffer, *BUF,
malloc'd by this function.

2.7 Symbols
===========

BFD tries to maintain as much symbol information as it can when it
moves information from file to file. BFD passes information to
applications though the `asymbol' structure. When the application
requests the symbol table, BFD reads the table in the native form and
translates parts of it into the internal format. To maintain more
than the information passed to applications, some targets keep some
information "behind the scenes" in a structure only the particular
back end knows about. For example, the coff back end keeps the
original symbol table structure as well as the canonical structure
when a BFD is read in. On output, the coff back end can reconstruct
the output symbol table so that no information is lost, even
information unique to coff which BFD doesn't know or understand. If a
coff symbol table were read, but were written through an a.out back
end, all the coff specific information would be lost. The symbol
table of a BFD is not necessarily read in until a canonicalize
request is made. Then the BFD back end fills in a table provided by
the application with pointers to the canonical information.  To
output symbols, the application provides BFD with a table of pointers
to pointers to `asymbol's. This allows applications like the linker
to output a symbol as it was read, since the "behind the scenes"
information will be still available.

2.7.1 Reading symbols
---------------------

There are two stages to reading a symbol table from a BFD: allocating
storage, and the actual reading process. This is an excerpt from an
application which reads the symbol table: 
              long storage_needed;
              asymbol **symbol_table;
              long number_of_symbols;
              long i;
     
              storage_needed = bfd_get_symtab_upper_bound (abfd);
     
              if (storage_needed < 0)
                FAIL
     
              if (storage_needed == 0)
                return;
     
              symbol_table = xmalloc (storage_needed);
                ...
              number_of_symbols =
                 bfd_canonicalize_symtab (abfd, symbol_table);
     
              if (number_of_symbols < 0)
                FAIL
     
              for (i = 0; i < number_of_symbols; i++)
                process_symbol (symbol_table[i]);
    All storage for the symbols themselves is in an objalloc
connected to the BFD; it is freed when the BFD is closed. 


File: bfd.info,  Node: Writing Symbols,  Next: Mini Symbols,  Prev: Reading Symbols,  Up: Symbols

2.7.2 Writing symbols
---------------------

Writing of a symbol table is automatic when a BFD open for writing is
closed. The application attaches a vector of pointers to pointers to
symbols to the BFD being written, and fills in the symbol count. The
close and cleanup code reads through the table provided and performs
all the necessary operations. The BFD output code must always be
provided with an "owned" symbol: one which has come from another BFD,
or one which has been created using `bfd_make_empty_symbol'.  Here is
an example showing the creation of a symbol table with only one
element: 
            #include "sysdep.h"
            #include "bfd.h"
            int main (void)
            {
              bfd *abfd;
              asymbol *ptrs[2];
              asymbol *new;
     
              abfd = bfd_openw ("foo","a.out-sunos-big");
              bfd_set_format (abfd, bfd_object);
              new = bfd_make_empty_symbol (abfd);
              new->name = "dummy_symbol";
              new->section = bfd_make_section_old_way (abfd, ".text");
              new->flags = BSF_GLOBAL;
              new->value = 0x12345;
     
              ptrs[0] = new;
              ptrs[1] = 0;
     
              bfd_set_symtab (abfd, ptrs, 1);
              bfd_close (abfd);
              return 0;
            }
     
            ./makesym
            nm foo
            00012345 A dummy_symbol
    Many formats cannot represent arbitrary symbol information; for
instance, the `a.out' object format does not allow an arbitrary
number of sections. A symbol pointing to a section which is not one
of `.text', `.data' or `.bss' cannot be described.

2.7.3 Mini Symbols
------------------

Mini symbols provide read-only access to the symbol table. They use
less memory space, but require more time to access. They can be
useful for tools like nm or objdump, which may have to handle symbol
tables of extremely large executables.  The `bfd_read_minisymbols'
function will read the symbols into memory in an internal form.  It
will return a `void *' pointer to a block of memory, a symbol count,
and the size of each symbol.  The pointer is allocated using
`malloc', and should be freed by the caller when it is no longer
needed.  The function `bfd_minisymbol_to_symbol' will take a
pointer to a minisymbol, and a pointer to a structure returned by
`bfd_make_empty_symbol', and return a `asymbol' structure. The return
value may or may not be the same as the value from
`bfd_make_empty_symbol' which was passed in.  


File: bfd.info,  Node: typedef asymbol,  Next: symbol handling functions,  Prev: Mini Symbols,  Up: Symbols

2.7.4 typedef asymbol
---------------------

An `asymbol' has the form:  
     
     typedef struct bfd_symbol
     {
       /* A pointer to the BFD which owns the symbol. This information
          is necessary so that a back end can work out what additional
          information (invisible to the application writer) is carried
          with the symbol.
     
          This field is *almost* redundant, since you can use section->owner
          instead, except that some symbols point to the global sections
          bfd_{abs,com,und}_section.  This could be fixed by making
          these globals be per-bfd (or per-target-flavor).  FIXME.  */
       struct bfd *the_bfd; /* Use bfd_asymbol_bfd(sym) to access this field.  */
     
       /* The text of the symbol. The name is left alone, and not copied; the
          application may not alter it.  */
       const char *name;
     
       /* The value of the symbol.  This really should be a union of a
          numeric value with a pointer, since some flags indicate that
          a pointer to another symbol is stored here.  */

   *Description*
 Return TRUE if a symbol with the name NAME in the BFD ABFD is a
compiler generated local label, else return FALSE.  This just checks
whether the name has the form of a local label.
     #define bfd_is_local_label_name(abfd, name) \
       BFD_SEND (abfd, _bfd_is_local_label_name, (abfd, name))

   *Description*
 Return TRUE iff a symbol SYM in the BFD ABFD is something special
to the particular target represented by the BFD.  Such symbols should
normally not be mentioned to the user.
     #define bfd_is_target_special_symbol(abfd, sym) \

2.8 Archives
============

  *Description*
 An archive (or library) is just another BFD.  It has a symbol
table, although there's not much a user program will do with it. 
The big difference between an archive BFD and an ordinary BFD is that
the archive doesn't have sections.  Instead it has a chain of BFDs
that are considered its contents.  These BFDs can be manipulated like
any other.  The BFDs contained in an archive opened for reading will
all be opened for reading.  You may put either input or output BFDs
into an archive opened for output; they will be handled correctly
when the archive is closed.  Use `bfd_openr_next_archived_file' to
step through the contents of an archive opened for input.  You don't
have to read the entire archive if you don't want to!  Read it until
you find what you want.  A BFD returned by
`bfd_openr_next_archived_file' can be closed manually with
`bfd_close'.  If you do not close it, then a second iteration through
the members of an archive may return the same BFD.  If you close the
archive BFD, then all the member BFDs will automatically be closed as
well.  Archive contents of output BFDs are chained through the
`archive_next' pointer in a BFD.  The first one is findable through
the `archive_head' slot of the archive.  Set it with
`bfd_set_archive_head' (q.v.).  A given BFD may be in only one open
output archive at a time.  As expected, the BFD archive code is
more general than the archive code of any given environment.  BFD
archives may contain files of different formats (e.g., a.out and
coff) and even different architectures.  You may even place archives
recursively into archives!  This can cause unexpected confusion,
since some archive formats are more expressive than others.  For
instance, Intel COFF archives can preserve long filenames; SunOS
a.out archives cannot.  If you move a file from the first to the
second format and back again, the filename may be truncated.
Likewise, different a.out environments have different conventions as
to how they truncate filenames, whether they preserve directory names
in filenames, etc.  When interoperating with native tools, be sure
your files are homogeneous.  Beware: most of these formats do not
react well to the presence of spaces in filenames.  We do the best we
can, but can't always handle this case due to restrictions in the
format of archives.  Many Unix utilities are braindead in regards to
spaces and such in filenames anyway, so this shouldn't be much of a
restriction.  Archives are supported in BFD in `archive.c'. 

2.8.1 Archive functions
-----------------------

  

2.8.1.1 `bfd_get_next_mapent'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     symindex bfd_get_next_mapent
        (bfd *abfd, symindex previous, carsym **sym);
   *Description*
 Step through archive ABFD's symbol table (if it has one).
Successively update SYM with the next symbol's information, returning
that symbol's (internal) index into the symbol table.  Supply
`BFD_NO_MORE_SYMBOLS' as the PREVIOUS entry to get the first one;
returns `BFD_NO_MORE_SYMBOLS' when you've already got the last one.
 A `carsym' is a canonical archive symbol.  The only user-visible
element is its name, a null-terminated string.  

2.8.1.2 `bfd_set_archive_head'
..............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_archive_head (bfd *output, bfd *new_head);
   *Description*
 Set the head of the chain of BFDs contained in the archive OUTPUT
to NEW_HEAD.  

2.8.1.3 `bfd_openr_next_archived_file'
......................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openr_next_archived_file (bfd *archive, bfd *previous);
   *Description*
 Provided a BFD, ARCHIVE, containing an archive and NULL, open an
input BFD on the first contained element and returns that. Subsequent
calls should pass the archive and the previous return value to return
a created BFD to the next contained element. NULL is returned when
there are no more.

2.9 File formats
================

A format is a BFD concept of high level file contents type. The
formats supported by BFD are: 
     

   * `bfd_object'
   The BFD may contain data, symbols, relocations and debug info. 
     

   * `bfd_archive'
   The BFD contains other BFDs and an optional index. 
     

   * `bfd_core'
   The BFD contains the result of an executable core dump. 

2.9.1 File format functions
---------------------------

  

2.9.1.1 `bfd_check_format'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_check_format (bfd *abfd, bfd_format format);
   *Description*
 Verify if the file attached to the BFD ABFD is compatible with the
format FORMAT (i.e., one of `bfd_object', `bfd_archive' or
`bfd_core').  If the BFD has been set to a specific target before
the call, only the named target and format combination is checked.
If the target has not been set, or has been set to `default', then
all the known target backends is interrogated to determine a match.
If the default target matches, it is used.  If not, exactly one
target must recognize the file, or an error results.  The
function returns `TRUE' on success, otherwise `FALSE' with one of the
following error codes: 
     

   * `bfd_error_invalid_operation' - if `format' is not one of
     `bfd_object', `bfd_archive' or `bfd_core'. 

   * `bfd_error_system_call' - if an error occured during a read -
     even some file mismatches can cause bfd_error_system_calls. 

   * `file_not_recognised' - none of the backends recognised the file
     format. 

   * `bfd_error_file_ambiguously_recognized' - more than one backend
     recognised the file format.
    

2.9.1.2 `bfd_check_format_matches'
..................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_check_format_matches
        (bfd *abfd, bfd_format format, char ***matching);
   *Description*
 Like `bfd_check_format', except when it returns FALSE with
`bfd_errno' set to `bfd_error_file_ambiguously_recognized'.  In that
case, if MATCHING is not NULL, it will be filled in with a
NULL-terminated list of the names of the formats that matched,
allocated with `malloc'. Then the user may choose a format and try
again.  When done with the list that MATCHING points to, the
caller should free it.  

2.9.1.3 `bfd_set_format'
........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_format (bfd *abfd, bfd_format format);
   *Description*
 This function sets the file format of the BFD ABFD to the format
FORMAT. If the target set in the BFD does not support the format
requested, the format is invalid, or the BFD is not open for writing,
then an error occurs.  

2.9.1.4 `bfd_format_string'
...........................

*Synopsis*
     const char *bfd_format_string (bfd_format format);
   *Description*
 Return a pointer to a const string `invalid', `object', `archive',
`core', or `unknown', depending upon the value of FORMAT.

2.10 Relocations
================

BFD maintains relocations in much the same way it maintains symbols:
they are left alone until required, then read in en-masse and
translated into an internal form.  A common routine
`bfd_perform_relocation' acts upon the canonical form to do the
fixup.  Relocations are maintained on a per section basis, while
symbols are maintained on a per BFD basis.  All that a back end has
to do to fit the BFD interface is to create a `struct
reloc_cache_entry' for each relocation in a particular section, and
fill in the right bits of the structures.

       /* Pointer to how to perform the required relocation.  */
       reloc_howto_type *howto;
     
     }
     arelent;
     
   *Description*
 Here is a description of each of the fields within an `arelent': 
     

   * `sym_ptr_ptr'
   The symbol table pointer points to a pointer to the symbol
associated with the relocation request.  It is the pointer into the
table returned by the back end's `canonicalize_symtab' action. *Note
Symbols::. The symbol is referenced through a pointer to a pointer so
that tools like the linker can fix up all the symbols of the same
name by modifying only one pointer. The relocation routine looks in
the symbol and uses the base of the section the symbol is attached to
and the value of the symbol as the initial relocation offset. If the
symbol pointer is zero, then the section provided is looked up. 
     

   * `address'
   The `address' field gives the offset in bytes from the base of the
section data which owns the relocation record to the first byte of
relocatable information. The actual data relocated will be relative
to this point; for example, a relocation type which modifies the
bottom two bytes of a four byte word would not touch the first byte
pointed to in a big endian world. 
     

   * `addend'
   The `addend' is a value provided by the back end to be added (!)
to the relocation offset. Its interpretation is dependent upon the
howto. For example, on the 68k the code: 
             char foo[];
             main()
                     {
                     return foo[0x12345678];
                     }
    Could be compiled into: 
             linkw fp,#-4
             moveb @#12345678,d0
             extbl d0
             unlk fp
             rts
    This could create a reloc pointing to `foo', but leave the
offset in the data, something like:

    Using coff and an 88k, some instructions don't have enough
space in them to represent the full address range, and pointers have
to be loaded in two parts. So you'd get something like: 
             or.u     r13,r0,hi16(_foo+0x12345678)
             ld.b     r2,r13,lo16(_foo+0x12345678)
             jmp      r1
    This should create two relocs, both pointing to `_foo', and with
0x12340000 in their addend field. The data would consist of: 
     RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
     offset   type      value
     00000002 HVRT16    _foo+0x12340000

     00000008 f400c001           ; jmp r1
    The relocation routine digs out the value from the data, adds
it to the addend to get the original offset, and then adds the value
of `_foo'. Note that all 32 bits have to be kept around somewhere, to
cope with carry from bit 15 to bit 16.  One further example is the
sparc and the a.out format. The sparc has a similar problem to the
88k, in that some instructions don't have room for an entire offset,
but on the sparc the parts are created in odd sized lumps. The
designers of the a.out format chose to not use the data within the
section for storing part of the offset; all the offset is kept
within the reloc. Anything in the data should be ignored.

             ret
             restore
    Both relocs contain a pointer to `foo', and the offsets contain
junk.

   * `howto'
   The `howto' field can be imagined as a relocation instruction. It
is a pointer to a structure which contains information on what to do
with all of the other information in the reloc record and data
section. A back end would normally have a relocation instruction set
and turn relocations into pointers to the correct structure on input
- but it would be possible to create each howto field on demand.

   *Description*
 Perform overflow checking on RELOCATION which has BITSIZE

         bfd *output_bfd,
         char **error_message);
   *Description*
 If OUTPUT_BFD is supplied to this function, the generated image
will be relocatable; the relocations are copied to the output file
after they have been changed to reflect the new state of the world.
There are two ways of reflecting the results of partial linkage in an
output file: by modifying the output data in place, and by modifying
the relocation record.  Some native formats (e.g., basic a.out and
basic coff) have no way of specifying an addend in the relocation
type, so the addend has to go in the output data. This is no big deal
since in these formats the output data slot will always be big enough
for the addend. Complex reloc types with addends were invented to
solve just this problem. The ERROR_MESSAGE argument is set to an
error message if this return `bfd_reloc_dangerous'.  

2.10.1.8 `bfd_install_relocation'

         asection *input_section,
         char **error_message);
   *Description*
 This looks remarkably like `bfd_perform_relocation', except it
does not expect that the section contents have been filled in. I.e.,
it's suitable for use when creating, rather than applying a
relocation.  For now, this function should be considered reserved
for the assembler.

2.10.2 The howto manager
------------------------

When an application wants to create a relocation, but doesn't know
what the target machine might call it, it can find out by using this
bit of code.  

2.10.2.1 `bfd_reloc_code_type'
..............................

*Description*
 The insides of a reloc code.  The idea is that, eventually, there
will be one enumerator for every type of relocation we ever do. Pass
one of these values to `bfd_reloc_type_lookup', and it'll return a
howto pointer.  This does mean that the application must determine
the correct enumerator value; you can't get a howto pointer from a
random set of attributes.  Here are the possible values for `enum
bfd_reloc_code_real':

     These PC-relative relocations are stored as word displacements -
     i.e., byte displacements shifted right two bits.  The 30-bit word
     displacement (<<32_PCREL_S2>> - 32 bits, shifted 2) is used on
     the SPARC.  (SPARC tools generally refer to this as
     <<WDISP30>>.)  The signed 16-bit displacement is used on the
     MIPS, and the 23-bit displacement is used on the Alpha.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_HI22

 -- : BFD_RELOC_SPU_ADD_PIC
     SPU Relocations.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP_HI16
     Alpha ECOFF and ELF relocations.  Some of these treat the symbol
     or "addend" in some special way. For GPDISP_HI16 ("gpdisp")
     relocations, the symbol is ignored when writing; when reading,
     it will be the absolute section symbol.  The addend is the
     displacement in bytes of the "lda" instruction from the "ldah"
     instruction (which is at the address of this reloc).

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP_LO16
     For GPDISP_LO16 ("ignore") relocations, the symbol is handled as
     with GPDISP_HI16 relocs.  The addend is ignored when writing the
     relocations out, and is filled in with the file's GP value on
     reading, for convenience.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP
     The ELF GPDISP relocation is exactly the same as the GPDISP_HI16
     relocation except that there is no accompanying GPDISP_LO16
     relocation.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LITERAL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_ELF_LITERAL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LITUSE
     The Alpha LITERAL/LITUSE relocs are produced by a symbol
     reference; the assembler turns it into a LDQ instruction to load
     the address of the symbol, and then fills in a register in the
     real instruction.  The LITERAL reloc, at the LDQ instruction,
     refers to the .lita section symbol.  The addend is ignored when
     writing, but is filled in with the file's GP value on reading,
     for convenience, as with the GPDISP_LO16 reloc.  The
     ELF_LITERAL reloc is somewhere between 16_GOTOFF and GPDISP_LO16.
     It should refer to the symbol to be referenced, as with
     16_GOTOFF, but it generates output not based on the position
     within the .got section, but relative to the GP value chosen for
     the file during the final link stage.  The LITUSE reloc, on
     the instruction using the loaded address, gives information to
     the linker that it might be able to use to optimize away some
     literal section references.  The symbol is ignored (read as the
     absolute section symbol), and the "addend" indicates the type of
     instruction using the register: 1 - "memory" fmt insn 2 -
     byte-manipulation (byte offset reg) 3 - jsr (target of branch)

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_HINT
     The HINT relocation indicates a value that should be filled into
     the "hint" field of a jmp/jsr/ret instruction, for possible
     branch- prediction logic which may be provided on some
     processors.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LINKAGE
     The LINKAGE relocation outputs a linkage pair in the object file,
     which is filled by the linker.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_CODEADDR
     The CODEADDR relocation outputs a STO_CA in the object file,
     which is filled by the linker.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPREL_HI16
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPREL_LO16
     The GPREL_HI/LO relocations together form a 32-bit offset from
     the GP register.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_BRSGP
     Like BFD_RELOC_23_PCREL_S2, except that the source and target
     must share a common GP, and the target address is adjusted for
     STO_ALPHA_STD_GPLOAD.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_NOP
     The NOP relocation outputs a NOP if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^21.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_BSR
     The BSR relocation outputs a BSR if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^21.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LDA
     The LDA relocation outputs a LDA if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^16.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_BOH
     The BOH relocation outputs a BSR if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^21, or else a hint.

     and are not stored in the instruction.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_ARM_PCREL_BLX
     ARM 26 bit pc-relative branch.  The lowest bit must be zero and
     is not stored in the instruction.  The 2nd lowest bit comes from
     a 1 bit field in the instruction.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_THUMB_PCREL_BLX
     Thumb 22 bit pc-relative branch.  The lowest bit must be zero and

     These two relocations are used by the linker to determine which
     of the entries in a C++ virtual function table are actually
     used.  When the -gc-sections option is given, the linker will
     zero out the entries that are not used, so that the code for
     those functions need not be included in the output. 
     VTABLE_INHERIT is a zero-space relocation used to describe to the
     linker the inheritance tree of a C++ virtual function table.  The
     relocation's symbol should be the parent class' vtable, and the
     relocation should be located at the child vtable. 
     VTABLE_ENTRY is a zero-space relocation that describes the use of
     a virtual function table entry.  The reloc's symbol should refer
     to the table of the class mentioned in the code.  Off of that
     base, an offset describes the entry that is being used.  For
     Rela hosts, this offset is stored in the reloc's addend.  For
     Rel hosts, we are forced to put this offset in the reloc's
     section offset.

   *Description*
 Return TRUE if the core file attached to CORE_BFD was generated by
a run of the executable file attached to EXEC_BFD.  The match is
based on executable basenames only.  Note: When not able to
determine the core file failing command or the executable name, we
still return TRUE even though we're not sure that core file and
executable match. This is to avoid generating a false warning in
situations where we really don't know whether they match or not.

2.12 Targets
============

  *Description*
 Each port of BFD to a different machine requires the creation of a
target back end. All the back end provides to the root part of BFD is
a structure containing pointers to functions which perform certain
low level operations on files. BFD translates the applications's
requests through a pointer into calls to the back end routines. 
When a file is opened with `bfd_openr', its format and target are
unknown. BFD uses various mechanisms to determine how to interpret
the file. The operations performed are: 
     

   * Create a BFD by calling the internal routine `_bfd_new_bfd',
     then call `bfd_find_target' with the target string supplied to
     `bfd_openr' and the new BFD pointer. 

   * If a null target string was provided to `bfd_find_target', look
     up the environment variable `GNUTARGET' and use that as the
     target string. 

   * If the target string is still `NULL', or the target string is
     `default', then use the first item in the target vector as the
     target type, and set `target_defaulted' in the BFD to cause
     `bfd_check_format' to loop through all the targets. *Note
     bfd_target::.  *Note Formats::. 

   * Otherwise, inspect the elements in the target vector one by one,
     until a match on target name is found. When found, use it. 

   * Otherwise return the error `bfd_error_invalid_target' to
     `bfd_openr'. 

   * `bfd_openr' attempts to open the file using `bfd_open_file', and
     returns the BFD.
   Once the BFD has been opened and the target selected, the file
format may be determined. This is done by calling `bfd_check_format'
on the BFD with a suggested format. If `target_defaulted' has been
set, each possible target type is tried to see if it recognizes the
specified format. `bfd_check_format' returns `TRUE' when the caller
guesses right.

2.12.1 bfd_target
-----------------

  *Description*
 This structure contains everything that BFD knows about a target.
It includes things like its byte order, name, and which routines to
call to do various operations.  Every BFD points to a target
structure with its `xvec' member.  The macros below are used to
dispatch to functions through the `bfd_target' vector. They are used
in a number of macros further down in `bfd.h', and are also used when
calling various routines by hand inside the BFD implementation.  The
ARGLIST argument must be parenthesized; it contains all the
arguments to the called function.  They make the documentation
(more) unpleasant to read, so if someone wants to fix this and not
break the above, please do.
     #define BFD_SEND(bfd, message, arglist) \
       ((*((bfd)->xvec->message)) arglist)
     
     #ifdef DEBUG_BFD_SEND
     #undef BFD_SEND
     #define BFD_SEND(bfd, message, arglist) \
       (((bfd) && (bfd)->xvec && (bfd)->xvec->message) ? \
         ((*((bfd)->xvec->message)) arglist) : \
         (bfd_assert (__FILE__,__LINE__), NULL))
     #endif
   For operations which index on the BFD format:
     #define BFD_SEND_FMT(bfd, message, arglist) \
       (((bfd)->xvec->message[(int) ((bfd)->format)]) arglist)
     
     #ifdef DEBUG_BFD_SEND
     #undef BFD_SEND_FMT
     #define BFD_SEND_FMT(bfd, message, arglist) \
       (((bfd) && (bfd)->xvec && (bfd)->xvec->message) ? \
        (((bfd)->xvec->message[(int) ((bfd)->format)]) arglist) : \
        (bfd_assert (__FILE__,__LINE__), NULL))
     #endif
     
   This is the structure which defines the type of BFD this is.  The
`xvec' member of the struct `bfd' itself points here.  Each module
that implements access to a different target under BFD, defines one
of these.  FIXME, these names should be rationalised with the names
of the entry points which call them. Too bad we can't have one
macro to define them both!

2.12.1.1 `bfd_set_default_target'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_default_target (const char *name);
   *Description*
 Set the default target vector to use when recognizing a BFD. This
takes the name of the target, which may be a BFD target name or a
configuration triplet.  

2.12.1.2 `bfd_find_target'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     const bfd_target *bfd_find_target (const char *target_name, bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
 Return a pointer to the transfer vector for the object target
named TARGET_NAME.  If TARGET_NAME is `NULL', choose the one in the
environment variable `GNUTARGET'; if that is null or not defined,
then choose the first entry in the target list.  Passing in the
string "default" or setting the environment variable to "default"
will cause the first entry in the target list to be returned, and
"target_defaulted" will be set in the BFD if ABFD isn't `NULL'.  This
causes `bfd_check_format' to loop over all the targets to find the
one that matches the file being read.  

2.12.1.3 `bfd_get_target_info'
..............................

*Synopsis*
     const bfd_target *bfd_get_target_info (const char *target_name,
         bfd *abfd,
         bfd_boolean *is_bigendian,
         int *underscoring,
         const char **def_target_arch);
   *Description*
 Return a pointer to the transfer vector for the object target
named TARGET_NAME.  If TARGET_NAME is `NULL', choose the one in the
environment variable `GNUTARGET'; if that is null or not defined,
then choose the first entry in the target list.  Passing in the
string "default" or setting the environment variable to "default"
will cause the first entry in the target list to be returned, and
"target_defaulted" will be set in the BFD if ABFD isn't `NULL'.  This
causes `bfd_check_format' to loop over all the targets to find the
one that matches the file being read. If IS_BIGENDIAN is not `NULL',
then set this value to target's endian mode. True for big-endian,
FALSE for little-endian or for invalid target. If UNDERSCORING is
not `NULL', then set this value to target's underscoring mode. Zero
for none-underscoring, -1 for invalid target, else the value of
target vector's symbol underscoring. If DEF_TARGET_ARCH is not
`NULL', then set it to the architecture string specified by the
target_name.  

2.12.1.4 `bfd_target_list'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     const char ** bfd_target_list (void);
   *Description*
 Return a freshly malloced NULL-terminated vector of the names of
all the valid BFD targets. Do not modify the names.  

2.12.1.5 `bfd_seach_for_target'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     const bfd_target *bfd_search_for_target
        (int (*search_func) (const bfd_target *, void *),
         void *);
   *Description*
 Return a pointer to the first transfer vector in the list of
transfer vectors maintained by BFD that produces a non-zero result
when passed to the function SEARCH_FUNC.  The parameter DATA is
passed, unexamined, to the search function.

2.13 Architectures
==================

BFD keeps one atom in a BFD describing the architecture of the data
attached to the BFD: a pointer to a `bfd_arch_info_type'. 
Pointers to structures can be requested independently of a BFD so
that an architecture's information can be interrogated without access
to an open BFD.  The architecture information is provided by each
architecture package. The set of default architectures is selected by
the macro `SELECT_ARCHITECTURES'.  This is normally set up in the
`config/TARGET.mt' file of your choice.  If the name is not defined,
then all the architectures supported are included.  When BFD starts
up, all the architectures are called with an initialize method.  It
is up to the architecture back end to insert as many items into the
list of architectures as it wants to; generally this would be one for
each machine and one for the default case (an item with a machine
field of 0).  BFD's idea of an architecture is implemented in
`archures.c'. 

2.13.1 bfd_architecture

  *Description*
 This enum gives the object file's CPU architecture, in a global
sense--i.e., what processor family does it belong to? Another field
indicates which processor within the family is in use.  The machine
gives a number which distinguishes different versions of the
architecture, containing, for example, 2 and 3 for Intel i960 KA and
i960 KB, and 68020 and 68030 for Motorola 68020 and 68030.

2.14 Opening and closing BFDs
=============================

 

2.14.1 Functions for opening and closing
----------------------------------------

  

2.14.1.1 `bfd_fopen'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_fopen (const char *filename, const char *target,
         const char *mode, int fd);
   *Description*
 Open the file FILENAME with the target TARGET. Return a pointer to
the created BFD.  If FD is not -1, then `fdopen' is used to open the
file; otherwise, `fopen' is used.  MODE is passed directly to `fopen'
or `fdopen'.  Calls `bfd_find_target', so TARGET is interpreted
as by that function.  The new BFD is marked as cacheable iff FD
is -1.  If `NULL' is returned then an error has occured.   Possible
errors are `bfd_error_no_memory', `bfd_error_invalid_target' or
`system_call' error.  On error, FD is always closed.  

2.14.1.2 `bfd_openr'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openr (const char *filename, const char *target);
   *Description*
 Open the file FILENAME (using `fopen') with the target TARGET.
Return a pointer to the created BFD.  Calls `bfd_find_target', so
TARGET is interpreted as by that function.  If `NULL' is returned
then an error has occured.   Possible errors are
`bfd_error_no_memory', `bfd_error_invalid_target' or `system_call'
error.  

2.14.1.3 `bfd_fdopenr'
......................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_fdopenr (const char *filename, const char *target, int fd);
   *Description*
 `bfd_fdopenr' is to `bfd_fopenr' much like `fdopen' is to `fopen'.
It opens a BFD on a file already described by the FD supplied. 
When the file is later `bfd_close'd, the file descriptor will be
closed.  If the caller desires that this file descriptor be cached by
BFD (opened as needed, closed as needed to free descriptors for other
opens), with the supplied FD used as an initial file descriptor (but
subject to closure at any time), call bfd_set_cacheable(bfd, 1) on
the returned BFD.  The default is to assume no caching; the file
descriptor will remain open until `bfd_close', and will not be
affected by BFD operations on other files.  Possible errors are
`bfd_error_no_memory', `bfd_error_invalid_target' and
`bfd_error_system_call'.  On error, FD is closed.  

2.14.1.4 `bfd_openstreamr'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openstreamr (const char *, const char *, void *);
   *Description*
 Open a BFD for read access on an existing stdio stream.  When the
BFD is passed to `bfd_close', the stream will be closed.  

2.14.1.5 `bfd_openr_iovec'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openr_iovec (const char *filename, const char *target,
         void *(*open_func) (struct bfd *nbfd,
         void *open_closure),
         void *open_closure,
         file_ptr (*pread_func) (struct bfd *nbfd,
         void *stream,
         void *buf,
         file_ptr nbytes,
         file_ptr offset),
         int (*close_func) (struct bfd *nbfd,
         void *stream),
         int (*stat_func) (struct bfd *abfd,
         void *stream,
         struct stat *sb));
   *Description*
 Create and return a BFD backed by a read-only STREAM. The STREAM
is created using OPEN_FUNC, accessed using PREAD_FUNC and destroyed
using CLOSE_FUNC.  Calls `bfd_find_target', so TARGET is
interpreted as by that function.  Calls OPEN_FUNC (which can call
`bfd_zalloc' and `bfd_get_filename') to obtain the read-only stream
backing the BFD.  OPEN_FUNC either succeeds returning the
non-`NULL' STREAM, or fails returning `NULL' (setting `bfd_error').
 Calls PREAD_FUNC to request NBYTES of data from STREAM starting at
OFFSET (e.g., via a call to `bfd_read').  PREAD_FUNC either succeeds
returning the number of bytes read (which can be less than NBYTES
when end-of-file), or fails returning -1 (setting `bfd_error'). 
Calls CLOSE_FUNC when the BFD is later closed using `bfd_close'.
CLOSE_FUNC either succeeds returning 0, or fails returning -1
(setting `bfd_error').  Calls STAT_FUNC to fill in a stat structure
for bfd_stat, bfd_get_size, and bfd_get_mtime calls.  STAT_FUNC
returns 0 on success, or returns -1 on failure (setting
`bfd_error').  If `bfd_openr_iovec' returns `NULL' then an error
has occurred.  Possible errors are `bfd_error_no_memory',
`bfd_error_invalid_target' and `bfd_error_system_call'.  

2.14.1.6 `bfd_openw'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openw (const char *filename, const char *target);
   *Description*
 Create a BFD, associated with file FILENAME, using the file format
TARGET, and return a pointer to it.  Possible errors are
`bfd_error_system_call', `bfd_error_no_memory',
`bfd_error_invalid_target'.  

2.14.1.7 `bfd_close'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_close (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
 Close a BFD. If the BFD was open for writing, then pending
operations are completed and the file written out and closed. If the
created file is executable, then `chmod' is called to mark it as
such.  All memory attached to the BFD is released.  The file
descriptor associated with the BFD is closed (even if it was passed
in to BFD by `bfd_fdopenr').  *Returns*
 `TRUE' is returned if all is ok, otherwise `FALSE'.  

2.14.1.8 `bfd_close_all_done'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_close_all_done (bfd *);
   *Description*
 Close a BFD.  Differs from `bfd_close' since it does not complete
any pending operations.  This routine would be used if the
application had just used BFD for swapping and didn't want to use any
of the writing code.  If the created file is executable, then
`chmod' is called to mark it as such.  All memory attached to the
BFD is released.  *Returns*
 `TRUE' is returned if all is ok, otherwise `FALSE'.  

2.14.1.9 `bfd_create'
.....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_create (const char *filename, bfd *templ);
   *Description*
 Create a new BFD in the manner of `bfd_openw', but without opening
a file. The new BFD takes the target from the target used by TEMPL.
The format is always set to `bfd_object'.  

2.14.1.10 `bfd_make_writable'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_make_writable (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
 Takes a BFD as created by `bfd_create' and converts it into one
like as returned by `bfd_openw'.  It does this by converting the BFD
to BFD_IN_MEMORY.  It's assumed that you will call
`bfd_make_readable' on this bfd later.  *Returns*
 `TRUE' is returned if all is ok, otherwise `FALSE'.  

2.14.1.11 `bfd_make_readable'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_make_readable (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
 Takes a BFD as created by `bfd_create' and `bfd_make_writable' and
converts it into one like as returned by `bfd_openr'.  It does this
by writing the contents out to the memory buffer, then reversing the
direction.  *Returns*
 `TRUE' is returned if all is ok, otherwise `FALSE'.  

2.14.1.12 `bfd_alloc'
.....................

*Synopsis*
     void *bfd_alloc (bfd *abfd, bfd_size_type wanted);

....................................

*Synopsis*
     char *bfd_follow_gnu_debuglink (bfd *abfd, const char *dir);
   *Description*
 Takes a BFD and searches it for a .gnu_debuglink section.  If this
section is found, it examines the section for the name and checksum
of a '.debug' file containing auxiliary debugging information.  It
then searches the filesystem for this .debug file in some standard
locations, including the directory tree rooted at DIR, and if found
returns the full filename.  If DIR is NULL, it will search a
default path configured into libbfd at build time.  [XXX this feature
is not currently implemented].  *Returns*
 `NULL' on any errors or failure to locate the .debug file,
otherwise a pointer to a heap-allocated string containing the

 Takes a BFD and searches it for a .gnu_debugaltlink section.  If
this section is found, it examines the section for the name of a
file containing auxiliary debugging information.  It then searches
the filesystem for this file in a set of standard locations,
including the directory tree rooted at DIR, and if found returns the
full filename.  If DIR is NULL, it will search a default path
configured into libbfd at build time.  [FIXME: This feature is not
currently implemented].  *Returns*
 `NULL' on any errors or failure to locate the debug file,
otherwise a pointer to a heap-allocated string containing the
filename.  The caller is responsible for freeing this string.

............................................

*Synopsis*
     struct bfd_section *bfd_create_gnu_debuglink_section
        (bfd *abfd, const char *filename);
   *Description*
 Takes a BFD and adds a .gnu_debuglink section to it.  The section is
sized to be big enough to contain a link to the specified FILENAME.
 *Returns*
 A pointer to the new section is returned if all is ok.  Otherwise
`NULL' is returned and bfd_error is set.

   *Description*
 Takes a BFD and containing a .gnu_debuglink section SECT and fills
in the contents of the section to contain a link to the specified
FILENAME.  The filename should be relative to the current directory.
 *Returns*
 `TRUE' is returned if all is ok.  Otherwise `FALSE' is returned
and bfd_error is set.

2.15 Implementation details
===========================

 

2.15.1 Internal functions
-------------------------

  *Description*
 These routines are used within BFD. They are not intended for
export, but are documented here for completeness.  

2.15.1.1 `bfd_write_bigendian_4byte_int'
........................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_write_bigendian_4byte_int (bfd *, unsigned int);
   *Description*
 Write a 4 byte integer I to the output BFD ABFD, in big endian
order regardless of what else is going on.  This is useful in
archives.  

2.15.1.2 `bfd_put_size'
.......................

2.15.1.3 `bfd_get_size'
.......................

*Description*
 These macros as used for reading and writing raw data in sections;
each access (except for bytes) is vectored through the target format
of the BFD and mangled accordingly. The mangling performs any
necessary endian translations and removes alignment restrictions.
Note that types accepted and returned by these macros are identical
so they can be swapped around in macros--for example, `libaout.h'
defines `GET_WORD' to either `bfd_get_32' or `bfd_get_64'.  In
the put routines, VAL must be a `bfd_vma'.  If we are on a system
without prototypes, the caller is responsible for making sure that is
true, with a cast if necessary.  We don't cast them in the macro
definitions because that would prevent `lint' or `gcc -Wall' from
detecting sins such as passing a pointer. To detect calling these
with less than a `bfd_vma', use `gcc -Wconversion' on a host with 64
bit `bfd_vma''s.

2.16 File caching
=================

The file caching mechanism is embedded within BFD and allows the
application to open as many BFDs as it wants without regard to the
underlying operating system's file descriptor limit (often as low as
20 open files).  The module in `cache.c' maintains a least recently
used list of `bfd_cache_max_open' files, and exports the name
`bfd_cache_lookup', which runs around and makes sure that the
required BFD is open. If not, then it chooses a file to close, closes
it and opens the one wanted, returning its file handle. 

2.16.1 Caching functions

2.16.1.2 `bfd_cache_close'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_cache_close (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
 Remove the BFD ABFD from the cache. If the attached file is open,
then close it too.  *Returns*
 `FALSE' is returned if closing the file fails, `TRUE' is returned
if all is well.  

2.16.1.3 `bfd_cache_close_all'
..............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_cache_close_all (void);
   *Description*
 Remove all BFDs from the cache. If the attached file is open, then
close it too.  *Returns*
 `FALSE' is returned if closing one of the file fails, `TRUE' is
returned if all is well.  

2.16.1.4 `bfd_open_file'
........................

*Synopsis*
     FILE* bfd_open_file (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
 Call the OS to open a file for ABFD.  Return the `FILE *'
(possibly `NULL') that results from this operation.  Set up the BFD
so that future accesses know the file is open. If the `FILE *'
returned is `NULL', then it won't have been put in the cache, so it
won't have to be removed from it.

2.17 Linker Functions
=====================

The linker uses three special entry points in the BFD target vector.
It is not necessary to write special routines for these entry points
when creating a new BFD back end, since generic versions are
provided.  However, writing them can speed up linking and make it use
significantly less runtime memory.  The first routine creates a
hash table used by the other routines.  The second routine adds the
symbols from an object file to the hash table.  The third routine
takes all the object files and links them together to create the
output file.  These routines are designed so that the linker proper
does not need to know anything about the symbols in the object files
that it is linking.  The linker merely arranges the sections as
directed by the linker script and lets BFD handle the details of
symbols and relocs.  The second routine and third routines are
passed a pointer to a `struct bfd_link_info' structure (defined in
`bfdlink.h') which holds information relevant to the link, including
the linker hash table (which was created by the first routine) and a
set of callback functions to the linker proper.  The generic
linker routines are in `linker.c', and use the header file
`genlink.h'.  As of this writing, the only back ends which have
implemented versions of these routines are a.out (in `aoutx.h') and
ECOFF (in `ecoff.c').  The a.out routines are used as examples
throughout this section.

2.17.1 Creating a linker hash table
-----------------------------------

The linker routines must create a hash table, which must be derived
from `struct bfd_link_hash_table' described in `bfdlink.c'.  *Note
Hash Tables::, for information on how to create a derived hash table.
This entry point is called using the target vector of the linker
output file.  The `_bfd_link_hash_table_create' entry point must
allocate and initialize an instance of the desired hash table.  If
the back end does not require any additional information to be
stored with the entries in the hash table, the entry point may simply
create a `struct bfd_link_hash_table'.  Most likely, however, some
additional information will be needed.  For example, with each
entry in the hash table the a.out linker keeps the index the symbol
has in the final output file (this index number is used so that when
doing a relocatable link the symbol index used in the output file can
be quickly filled in when copying over a reloc).  The a.out linker
code defines the required structures and functions for a hash table
derived from `struct bfd_link_hash_table'.  The a.out linker hash
table is created by the function `NAME(aout,link_hash_table_create)';
it simply allocates space for the hash table, initializes it, and
returns a pointer to it.  When writing the linker routines for a
new back end, you will generally not know exactly which fields will
be required until you have finished.  You should simply create a new
hash table which defines no additional fields, and then simply add
fields as they become necessary.

2.17.2 Adding symbols to the hash table
---------------------------------------

The linker proper will call the `_bfd_link_add_symbols' entry point
for each object file or archive which is to be linked (typically
these are the files named on the command line, but some may also come
from the linker script).  The entry point is responsible for
examining the file.  For an object file, BFD must add any relevant
symbol information to the hash table.  For an archive, BFD must
determine which elements of the archive should be used and adding
them to the link.  The a.out version of this entry point is
`NAME(aout,link_add_symbols)'.

File: bfd.info,  Node: Differing file formats,  Next: Adding symbols from an object file,  Prev: Adding Symbols to the Hash Table,  Up: Adding Symbols to the Hash Table

2.17.2.1 Differing file formats
...............................

Normally all the files involved in a link will be of the same format,
but it is also possible to link together different format object
files, and the back end must support that.  The
`_bfd_link_add_symbols' entry point is called via the target vector
of the file to be added.  This has an important consequence: the
function may not assume that the hash table is the type created by
the corresponding `_bfd_link_hash_table_create' vector.  All the
`_bfd_link_add_symbols' function can assume about the hash table is
that it is derived from `struct bfd_link_hash_table'.  Sometimes
the `_bfd_link_add_symbols' function must store some information in
the hash table entry to be used by the `_bfd_final_link' function.
In such a case the output bfd xvec must be checked to make sure that
the hash table was created by an object file of the same format. 
The `_bfd_final_link' routine must be prepared to handle a hash entry
without any extra information added by the `_bfd_link_add_symbols'
function.  A hash entry without extra information will also occur
when the linker script directs the linker to create a symbol.  Note
that, regardless of how a hash table entry is added, all the fields
will be initialized to some sort of null value by the hash table
entry initialization function.  See `ecoff_link_add_externals'
for an example of how to check the output bfd before saving
information (in this case, the ECOFF external symbol debugging
information) in a hash table entry.

2.17.2.2 Adding symbols from an object file
...........................................

When the `_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine is passed an object file, it
must add all externally visible symbols in that object file to the
hash table.  The actual work of adding the symbol to the hash table
is normally handled by the function
`_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol'.  The `_bfd_link_add_symbols'
routine is responsible for reading all the symbols from the object
file and passing the correct information to
`_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol'.  The `_bfd_link_add_symbols'
routine should not use `bfd_canonicalize_symtab' to read the symbols.
The point of providing this routine is to avoid the overhead of
converting the symbols into generic `asymbol' structures.  `_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol'
handles the details of combining common symbols, warning about
multiple definitions, and so forth.  It takes arguments which
describe the symbol to add, notably symbol flags, a section, and an
offset.  The symbol flags include such things as `BSF_WEAK' or
`BSF_INDIRECT'.  The section is a section in the object file, or
something like `bfd_und_section_ptr' for an undefined symbol or
`bfd_com_section_ptr' for a common symbol.  If the
`_bfd_final_link' routine is also going to need to read the symbol
information, the `_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine should save it
somewhere attached to the object file BFD.  However, the information
should only be saved if the `keep_memory' field of the `info'
argument is TRUE, so that the `-no-keep-memory' linker switch is
effective.  The a.out function which adds symbols from an object
file is `aout_link_add_object_symbols', and most of the interesting
work is in `aout_link_add_symbols'.  The latter saves pointers to the
hash tables entries created by `_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol'
indexed by symbol number, so that the `_bfd_final_link' routine does
not have to call the hash table lookup routine to locate the entry.

2.17.2.3 Adding symbols from an archive
.......................................

When the `_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine is passed an archive, it
must look through the symbols defined by the archive and decide which
elements of the archive should be included in the link.  For each
such element it must call the `add_archive_element' linker callback,
and it must add the symbols from the object file to the linker hash
table.  (The callback may in fact indicate that a replacement BFD
should be used, in which case the symbols from that BFD should be
added to the linker hash table instead.)  In most cases the work
of looking through the symbols in the archive should be done by the
`_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' function.  This function
builds a hash table from the archive symbol table and looks through
the list of undefined symbols to see which elements should be
included. `_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' is passed a
function to call to make the final decision about adding an archive
element to the link and to do the actual work of adding the symbols
to the linker hash table.  The function passed to
`_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' must read the symbols of the
archive element and decide whether the archive element should be
included in the link.  If the element is to be included, the
`add_archive_element' linker callback routine must be called with the
element as an argument, and the element's symbols must be added to
the linker hash table just as though the element had itself been
passed to the `_bfd_link_add_symbols' function.  The
`add_archive_element' callback has the option to indicate that it
would like to replace the element archive with a substitute BFD, in
which case it is the symbols of that substitute BFD that must be
added to the linker hash table instead.  When the a.out
`_bfd_link_add_symbols' function receives an archive, it calls
`_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' passing
`aout_link_check_archive_element' as the function argument.
`aout_link_check_archive_element' calls `aout_link_check_ar_symbols'.
If the latter decides to add the element (an element is only added if
it provides a real, non-common, definition for a previously undefined
or common symbol) it calls the `add_archive_element' callback and
then `aout_link_check_archive_element' calls
`aout_link_add_symbols' to actually add the symbols to the linker
hash table - possibly those of a substitute BFD, if the
`add_archive_element' callback avails itself of that option.  The
ECOFF back end is unusual in that it does not normally call
`_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols', because ECOFF archives
already contain a hash table of symbols.  The ECOFF back end searches
the archive itself to avoid the overhead of creating a new hash
table.

2.17.3 Performing the final link
--------------------------------

When all the input files have been processed, the linker calls the
`_bfd_final_link' entry point of the output BFD.  This routine is
responsible for producing the final output file, which has several
aspects.  It must relocate the contents of the input sections and
copy the data into the output sections. It must build an output
symbol table including any local symbols from the input files and the
global symbols from the hash table.  When producing relocatable
output, it must modify the input relocs and write them into the
output file. There may also be object format dependent work to be
done.  The linker will also call the `write_object_contents' entry
point when the BFD is closed.  The two entry points must work
together in order to produce the correct output file.  The details
of how this works are inevitably dependent upon the specific object
file format.  The a.out `_bfd_final_link' routine is
`NAME(aout,final_link)'.

some data structures for the function to use.  The `input_bfds'
field of the `bfd_link_info' structure will point to a list of all
the input files included in the link.  These files are linked through
the `link_next' field of the `bfd' structure.  Each section in
the output file will have a list of `link_order' structures attached
to the `map_head.link_order' field (the `link_order' structure is
defined in `bfdlink.h').  These structures describe how to create
the contents of the output section in terms of the contents of
various input sections, fill constants, and, eventually, other types
of information.  They also describe relocs that must be created by
the BFD backend, but do not correspond to any input file; this is
used to support -Ur, which builds constructors while generating a
relocatable object file.

2.17.3.2 Relocating the section contents
........................................

The `_bfd_final_link' function should look through the `link_order'
structures attached to each section of the output file.  Each
`link_order' structure should either be handled specially, or it
should be passed to the function `_bfd_default_link_order' which will
do the right thing (`_bfd_default_link_order' is defined in
`linker.c').  For efficiency, a `link_order' of type
`bfd_indirect_link_order' whose associated section belongs to a BFD
of the same format as the output BFD must be handled specially.  This
type of `link_order' describes part of an output section in terms of
a section belonging to one of the input files.  The `_bfd_final_link'
function should read the contents of the section and any associated
relocs, apply the relocs to the section contents, and write out the
modified section contents.  If performing a relocatable link, the
relocs themselves must also be modified and written out.  The
functions `_bfd_relocate_contents' and `_bfd_final_link_relocate'
provide some general support for performing the actual relocations,
notably overflow checking. Their arguments include information about
the symbol the relocation is against and a `reloc_howto_type'
argument which describes the relocation to perform.  These functions
are defined in `reloc.c'.  The a.out function which handles
reading, relocating, and writing section contents is
`aout_link_input_section'.  The actual relocation is done in
`aout_link_input_section_std' and `aout_link_input_section_ext'.

2.17.3.3 Writing the symbol table
.................................

The `_bfd_final_link' function must gather all the symbols in the
input files and write them out.  It must also write out all the
symbols in the global hash table.  This must be controlled by the
`strip' and `discard' fields of the `bfd_link_info' structure. 
The local symbols of the input files will not have been entered into
the linker hash table.  The `_bfd_final_link' routine must consider
each input file and include the symbols in the output file.  It may
be convenient to do this when looking through the `link_order'
structures, or it may be done by stepping through the `input_bfds'
list.  The `_bfd_final_link' routine must also traverse the global
hash table to gather all the externally visible symbols.  It is
possible that most of the externally visible symbols may be written
out when considering the symbols of each input file, but it is still
necessary to traverse the hash table since the linker script may have
defined some symbols that are not in any of the input files.  The
`strip' field of the `bfd_link_info' structure controls which symbols
are written out.  The possible values are listed in `bfdlink.h'.  If
the value is `strip_some', then the `keep_hash' field of the
`bfd_link_info' structure is a hash table of symbols to keep; each
symbol should be looked up in this hash table, and only symbols
which are present should be included in the output file.  If the
`strip' field of the `bfd_link_info' structure permits local symbols
to be written out, the `discard' field is used to further controls
which local symbols are included in the output file.  If the value is
`discard_l', then all local symbols which begin with a certain prefix
are discarded; this is controlled by the `bfd_is_local_label_name'
entry point.  The a.out backend handles symbols by calling
`aout_link_write_symbols' on each input BFD and then traversing the
global hash table with the function `aout_link_write_other_symbol'.
It builds a string table while writing out the symbols, which is
written to the output file at the end of `NAME(aout,final_link)'.

2.18 Hash Tables
================

BFD provides a simple set of hash table functions.  Routines are
provided to initialize a hash table, to free a hash table, to look up
a string in a hash table and optionally create an entry for it, and
to traverse a hash table.  There is currently no routine to delete an
string from a hash table.  The basic hash table does not permit any
data to be stored with a string.  However, a hash table is designed
to present a base class from which other types of hash tables may be
derived.  These derived types may store additional information with
the string.  Hash tables were implemented in this way, rather than
simply providing a data pointer in a hash table entry, because they
were designed for use by the linker back ends.  The linker may create
thousands of hash table entries, and the overhead of allocating
private data and storing and following pointers becomes noticeable.
 The basic hash table code is in `hash.c'.

2.18.1 Creating and freeing a hash table
----------------------------------------

To create a hash table, create an instance of a `struct
bfd_hash_table' (defined in `bfd.h') and call `bfd_hash_table_init'
(if you know approximately how many entries you will need, the
function `bfd_hash_table_init_n', which takes a SIZE argument, may be
used). `bfd_hash_table_init' returns `FALSE' if some sort of error
occurs.  The function `bfd_hash_table_init' take as an argument a
function to use to create new entries.  For a basic hash table, use
the function `bfd_hash_newfunc'.  *Note Deriving a New Hash Table
Type::, for why you would want to use a different value for this
argument.  `bfd_hash_table_init' will create an objalloc which will
be used to allocate new entries.  You may allocate memory on this
objalloc using `bfd_hash_allocate'.  Use `bfd_hash_table_free' to
free up all the memory that has been allocated for a hash table.
This will not free up the `struct bfd_hash_table' itself, which you
must provide.  Use `bfd_hash_set_default_size' to set the default
size of hash table to use. 


File: bfd.info,  Node: Looking Up or Entering a String,  Next: Traversing a Hash Table,  Prev: Creating and Freeing a Hash Table,  Up: Hash Tables

2.18.2 Looking up or entering a string
--------------------------------------

The function `bfd_hash_lookup' is used both to look up a string in
the hash table and to create a new entry.  If the CREATE argument
is `FALSE', `bfd_hash_lookup' will look up a string.  If the string
is found, it will returns a pointer to a `struct bfd_hash_entry'.  If
the string is not found in the table `bfd_hash_lookup' will return
`NULL'.  You should not modify any of the fields in the returns
`struct bfd_hash_entry'.  If the CREATE argument is `TRUE', the
string will be entered into the hash table if it is not already
there. Either way a pointer to a `struct bfd_hash_entry' will be
returned, either to the existing structure or to a newly created one.
In this case, a `NULL' return means that an error occurred.  If
the CREATE argument is `TRUE', and a new entry is created, the COPY
argument is used to decide whether to copy the string onto the hash
table objalloc or not.  If COPY is passed as `FALSE', you must be
careful not to deallocate or modify the string as long as the hash
table exists.

2.18.3 Traversing a hash table
------------------------------

The function `bfd_hash_traverse' may be used to traverse a hash
table, calling a function on each element.  The traversal is done in
a random order.  `bfd_hash_traverse' takes as arguments a function
and a generic `void *' pointer.  The function is called with a hash
table entry (a `struct bfd_hash_entry *') and the generic pointer
passed to `bfd_hash_traverse'.  The function must return a `boolean'
value, which indicates whether to continue traversing the hash table.
If the function returns `FALSE', `bfd_hash_traverse' will stop the
traversal and return immediately. 


File: bfd.info,  Node: Deriving a New Hash Table Type,  Prev: Traversing a Hash Table,  Up: Hash Tables

2.18.4 Deriving a new hash table type
-------------------------------------

Many uses of hash tables want to store additional information which
each entry in the hash table.  Some also find it convenient to store
additional information with the hash table itself.  This may be done
using a derived hash table.  Since C is not an object oriented
language, creating a derived hash table requires sticking together
some boilerplate routines with a few differences specific to the type
of hash table you want to create.  An example of a derived hash
table is the linker hash table. The structures for this are defined
in `bfdlink.h'.  The functions are in `linker.c'.  You may also
derive a hash table from an already derived hash table.  For example,
the a.out linker backend code uses a hash table derived from the
linker hash table.

2.18.4.1 Define the derived structures
......................................

You must define a structure for an entry in the hash table, and a
structure for the hash table itself.  The first field in the
structure for an entry in the hash table must be of the type used for
an entry in the hash table you are deriving from.  If you are
deriving from a basic hash table this is `struct bfd_hash_entry',
which is defined in `bfd.h'.  The first field in the structure for
the hash table itself must be of the type of the hash table you are
deriving from itself.  If you are deriving from a basic hash table,
this is `struct bfd_hash_table'.  For example, the linker hash
table defines `struct bfd_link_hash_entry' (in `bfdlink.h').  The
first field, `root', is of type `struct bfd_hash_entry'.  Similarly,
the first field in `struct bfd_link_hash_table', `table', is of type
`struct bfd_hash_table'. 


File: bfd.info,  Node: Write the Derived Creation Routine,  Next: Write Other Derived Routines,  Prev: Define the Derived Structures,  Up: Deriving a New Hash Table Type

2.18.4.2 Write the derived creation routine
...........................................

You must write a routine which will create and initialize an entry in
the hash table.  This routine is passed as the function argument to
`bfd_hash_table_init'.  In order to permit other hash tables to be
derived from the hash table you are creating, this routine must be
written in a standard way.  The first argument to the creation
routine is a pointer to a hash table entry.  This may be `NULL', in
which case the routine should allocate the right amount of space.
Otherwise the space has already been allocated by a hash table type
derived from this one.  After allocating space, the creation
routine must call the creation routine of the hash table type it is
derived from, passing in a pointer to the space it just allocated.
This will initialize any fields used by the base hash table. 
Finally the creation routine must initialize any local fields for the
new hash table type.  Here is a boilerplate example of a creation
routine. FUNCTION_NAME is the name of the routine. ENTRY_TYPE is
the type of an entry in the hash table you are creating.
BASE_NEWFUNC is the name of the creation routine of the hash table
type your hash table is derived from.  
     struct bfd_hash_entry *
     FUNCTION_NAME (struct bfd_hash_entry *entry,
                          struct bfd_hash_table *table,
                          const char *string)
     {
       struct ENTRY_TYPE *ret = (ENTRY_TYPE *) entry;
     
      /* Allocate the structure if it has not already been allocated by a
         derived class.  */
       if (ret == NULL)
         {
           ret = bfd_hash_allocate (table, sizeof (* ret));
           if (ret == NULL)
             return NULL;
         }
     
      /* Call the allocation method of the base class.  */
       ret = ((ENTRY_TYPE *)
             BASE_NEWFUNC ((struct bfd_hash_entry *) ret, table, string));
     
      /* Initialize the local fields here.  */
     
       return (struct bfd_hash_entry *) ret;
     }
   *Description*
 The creation routine for the linker hash table, which is in
`linker.c', looks just like this example. FUNCTION_NAME is
`_bfd_link_hash_newfunc'. ENTRY_TYPE is `struct
bfd_link_hash_entry'. BASE_NEWFUNC is `bfd_hash_newfunc', the
creation routine for a basic hash table. 
`_bfd_link_hash_newfunc' also initializes the local fields in a
linker hash table entry: `type', `written' and `next'. 


File: bfd.info,  Node: Write Other Derived Routines,  Prev: Write the Derived Creation Routine,  Up: Deriving a New Hash Table Type

2.18.4.3 Write other derived routines
.....................................

You will want to write other routines for your new hash table, as
well.  You will want an initialization routine which calls the
initialization routine of the hash table you are deriving from and
initializes any other local fields.  For the linker hash table, this
is `_bfd_link_hash_table_init' in `linker.c'.  You will want a
lookup routine which calls the lookup routine of the hash table you
are deriving from and casts the result. The linker hash table uses
`bfd_link_hash_lookup' in `linker.c' (this actually takes an
additional argument which it uses to decide how to return the looked
up value).  You may want a traversal routine.  This should just
call the traversal routine of the hash table you are deriving from
with appropriate casts.  The linker hash table uses
`bfd_link_hash_traverse' in `linker.c'.  These routines may simply
be defined as macros.  For example, the a.out backend linker hash
table, which is derived from the linker hash table, uses macros for
the lookup and traversal routines.  These are `aout_link_hash_lookup'
and `aout_link_hash_traverse' in aoutx.h.

All of BFD lives in one directory.


File: bfd.info,  Node: aout,  Next: coff,  Prev: What to Put Where,  Up: BFD back ends

3.2 a.out backends
==================

  *Description*
 BFD supports a number of different flavours of a.out format,
though the major differences are only the sizes of the structures on
disk, and the shape of the relocation information.  The support
is split into a basic support file `aoutx.h' and other files which
derive functions from the base. One derivation file is `aoutf1.h'
(for a.out flavour 1), and adds to the basic a.out functions support
for sun3, sun4, 386 and 29k a.out files, to create a target jump
vector for a specific target.  This information is further split
out into more specific files for each machine, including `sunos.c'
for sun3 and sun4, `newsos3.c' for the Sony NEWS, and `demo64.c' for
a demonstration of a 64 bit a.out format.  The base file
`aoutx.h' defines general mechanisms for reading and writing records
to and from disk and various other methods which BFD requires. It is
included by `aout32.c' and `aout64.c' to form the names
`aout_32_swap_exec_header_in', `aout_64_swap_exec_header_in', etc. 
As an example, this is what goes on to make the back end for a sun4,
from `aout32.c': 
            #define ARCH_SIZE 32
            #include "aoutx.h"
    Which exports names: 
            ...
            aout_32_canonicalize_reloc
            aout_32_find_nearest_line
            aout_32_get_lineno
            aout_32_get_reloc_upper_bound
            ...
    from `sunos.c': 
            #define TARGET_NAME "a.out-sunos-big"
            #define VECNAME    sunos_big_vec
            #include "aoutf1.h"
    requires all the names from `aout32.c', and produces the jump
vector 
            sunos_big_vec
    The file `host-aout.c' is a special case.  It is for a large set
of hosts that use "more or less standard" a.out files, and for which
cross-debugging is not interesting.  It uses the standard 32-bit
a.out support routines, but determines the file offsets and addresses
of the text, data, and BSS sections, the machine architecture and
machine type, and the entry point address, in a host-dependent
manner.  Once these values have been determined, generic code is used
to handle the  object file.  When porting it to run on a new
system, you must supply: 
             HOST_PAGE_SIZE
             HOST_SEGMENT_SIZE
             HOST_MACHINE_ARCH       (optional)
             HOST_MACHINE_MACHINE    (optional)
             HOST_TEXT_START_ADDR
             HOST_STACK_END_ADDR
    in the file `../include/sys/h-XXX.h' (for your host).  These
values, plus the structures and macros defined in `a.out.h' on your
host system, will produce a BFD target that will access ordinary
a.out files on your host. To configure a new machine to use
`host-aout.c', specify: 
            TDEFAULTS = -DDEFAULT_VECTOR=host_aout_big_vec
            TDEPFILES= host-aout.o trad-core.o
    in the `config/XXX.mt' file, and modify `configure.in' to use
the `XXX.mt' file (by setting "`bfd_target=XXX'") when your
configuration is selected. 

3.2.1 Relocations
-----------------

  *Description*
 The file `aoutx.h' provides for both the _standard_ and _extended_
forms of a.out relocation records.  The standard records contain
only an address, a symbol index, and a type field. The extended
records (used on 29ks and sparcs) also have a full integer for an
addend. 

3.2.2 Internal entry points
---------------------------

  *Description*
 `aoutx.h' exports several routines for accessing the contents of
an a.out file, which are gathered and exported in turn by various
format specific files (eg sunos.c).

=================

BFD supports a number of different flavours of coff format. The major
differences between formats are the sizes and alignments of fields in
structures on disk, and the occasional extra field.  Coff in all
its varieties is implemented with a few common files and a number of
implementation specific files. For example, The 88k bcs coff format
is implemented in the file `coff-m88k.c'. This file `#include's
`coff/m88k.h' which defines the external structure of the coff format
for the 88k, and `coff/internal.h' which defines the internal
structure. `coff-m88k.c' also defines the relocations used by the 88k
format *Note Relocations::.  The Intel i960 processor version of
coff is implemented in `coff-i960.c'. This file has the same
structure as `coff-m88k.c', except that it includes `coff/i960.h'
rather than `coff-m88k.h'. 

3.3.1 Porting to a new version of coff
--------------------------------------

The recommended method is to select from the existing implementations
the version of coff which is most like the one you want to use.  For
example, we'll say that i386 coff is the one you select, and that
your coff flavour is called foo. Copy `i386coff.c' to `foocoff.c',
copy `../include/coff/i386.h' to `../include/coff/foo.h', and add
the lines to `targets.c' and `Makefile.in' so that your new back end
is used. Alter the shapes of the structures in
`../include/coff/foo.h' so that they match what you need. You will
probably also have to add `#ifdef's to the code in `coff/internal.h'
and `coffcode.h' if your version of coff is too wild.  You can
verify that your new BFD backend works quite simply by building
`objdump' from the `binutils' directory, and making sure that its
version of what's going on and your host system's idea (assuming it
has the pretty standard coff dump utility, usually called `att-dump'
or just `dump') are the same.  Then clean up your code, and send
what you've done to Cygnus. Then your stuff will be in the next
release, and you won't have to keep integrating it. 

3.3.2 How the coff backend works
--------------------------------

 

3.3.2.1 File layout
...................

The Coff backend is split into generic routines that are applicable
to any Coff target and routines that are specific to a particular
target.  The target-specific routines are further split into ones
which are basically the same for all Coff targets except that they
use the external symbol format or use different values for certain
constants.  The generic routines are in `coffgen.c'.  These
routines work for any Coff target.  They use some hooks into the
target specific code; the hooks are in a `bfd_coff_backend_data'
structure, one of which exists for each target.  The essentially
similar target-specific routines are in `coffcode.h'.  This header
file includes executable C code. The various Coff targets first
include the appropriate Coff header file, make any special defines
that are needed, and then include `coffcode.h'.  Some of the Coff
targets then also have additional routines in the target source file
itself.  For example, `coff-i960.c' includes `coff/internal.h'
and `coff/i960.h'.  It then defines a few constants, such as `I960',
and includes `coffcode.h'.  Since the i960 has complex relocation
types, `coff-i960.c' also includes some code to manipulate the i960
relocs.  This code is not in `coffcode.h' because it would not be
used by any other target. 

3.3.2.2 Coff long section names
...............................

In the standard Coff object format, section names are limited to the
eight bytes available in the `s_name' field of the `SCNHDR' section
header structure.  The format requires the field to be NUL-padded,
but not necessarily NUL-terminated, so the longest section names
permitted are a full eight characters.  The Microsoft PE variants
of the Coff object file format add an extension to support the use of
long section names.  This extension is defined in section 4 of the
Microsoft PE/COFF specification (rev 8.1).  If a section name is too
long to fit into the section header's `s_name' field, it is instead
placed into the string table, and the `s_name' field is filled with a
slash ("/") followed by the ASCII decimal representation of the
offset of the full name relative to the string table base.  Note
that this implies that the extension can only be used in object
files, as executables do not contain a string table.  The standard
specifies that long section names from objects emitted into executable
images are to be truncated.  However, as a GNU extension, BFD can
generate executable images that contain a string table and long
section names.  This would appear to be technically valid, as the
standard only says that Coff debugging information is deprecated, not
forbidden, and in practice it works, although some tools that parse
PE files expecting the MS standard format may become confused;
`PEview' is one known example.  The functionality is supported in
BFD by code implemented under the control of the macro
`COFF_LONG_SECTION_NAMES'.  If not defined, the format does not
support long section names in any way. If defined, it is used to
initialise a flag, `_bfd_coff_long_section_names', and a hook
function pointer, `_bfd_coff_set_long_section_names', in the Coff
backend data structure.  The flag controls the generation of long
section names in output BFDs at runtime; if it is false, as it will
be by default when generating an executable image, long section names
are truncated; if true, the long section names extension is employed.
The hook points to a function that allows the value of the flag to be
altered at runtime, on formats that support long section names at
all; on other formats it points to a stub that returns an error
indication.  With input BFDs, the flag is set according to whether
any long section names are detected while reading the section
headers.  For a completely new BFD, the flag is set to the default
for the target format.  This information can be used by a client of
the BFD library when deciding what output format to generate, and
means that a BFD that is opened for read and subsequently converted
to a writeable BFD and modified in-place will retain whatever format
it had on input.  If `COFF_LONG_SECTION_NAMES' is simply defined
(blank), or is defined to the value "1", then long section names are
enabled by default; if it is defined to the value zero, they are
disabled by default (but still accepted in input BFDs).  The header
`coffcode.h' defines a macro, `COFF_DEFAULT_LONG_SECTION_NAMES',
which is used in the backends to initialise the backend data
structure fields appropriately; see the comments for further detail.


3.3.2.3 Bit twiddling
.....................

Each flavour of coff supported in BFD has its own header file
describing the external layout of the structures. There is also an
internal description of the coff layout, in `coff/internal.h'. A
major function of the coff backend is swapping the bytes and
twiddling the bits to translate the external form of the structures
into the normal internal form. This is all performed in the
`bfd_swap'_thing_direction routines. Some elements are different
sizes between different versions of coff; it is the duty of the coff
version specific include file to override the definitions of various
packing routines in `coffcode.h'. E.g., the size of line number entry
in coff is sometimes 16 bits, and sometimes 32 bits. `#define'ing
`PUT_LNSZ_LNNO' and `GET_LNSZ_LNNO' will select the correct one. No
doubt, some day someone will find a version of coff which has a
varying field size not catered to at the moment. To port BFD, that
person will have to add more `#defines'. Three of the bit twiddling
routines are exported to `gdb'; `coff_swap_aux_in',
`coff_swap_sym_in' and `coff_swap_lineno_in'. `GDB' reads the symbol
table on its own, but uses BFD to fix things up.  More of the bit
twiddlers are exported for `gas'; `coff_swap_aux_out',
`coff_swap_sym_out', `coff_swap_lineno_out', `coff_swap_reloc_out',
`coff_swap_filehdr_out', `coff_swap_aouthdr_out',
`coff_swap_scnhdr_out'. `Gas' currently keeps track of all the symbol
table and reloc drudgery itself, thereby saving the internal BFD
overhead, but uses BFD to swap things on the way out, making cross
ports much safer.  Doing so also allows BFD (and thus the linker) to
use the same header files as `gas', which makes one avenue to
disaster disappear. 

3.3.2.4 Symbol reading
......................

The simple canonical form for symbols used by BFD is not rich enough
to keep all the information available in a coff symbol table. The
back end gets around this problem by keeping the original symbol
table around, "behind the scenes".  When a symbol table is
requested (through a call to `bfd_canonicalize_symtab'), a request
gets through to `coff_get_normalized_symtab'. This reads the symbol
table from the coff file and swaps all the structures inside into
the internal form. It also fixes up all the pointers in the table
(represented in the file by offsets from the first symbol in the
table) into physical pointers to elements in the new internal table.
This involves some work since the meanings of fields change depending
upon context: a field that is a pointer to another structure in the
symbol table at one moment may be the size in bytes of a structure at
the next.  Another pass is made over the table. All symbols which
mark file names (`C_FILE' symbols) are modified so that the internal
string points to the value in the auxent (the real filename) rather
than the normal text associated with the symbol (`".file"').  At
this time the symbol names are moved around. Coff stores all symbols
less than nine characters long physically within the symbol table;
longer strings are kept at the end of the file in the string table.
This pass moves all strings into memory and replaces them with
pointers to the strings.  The symbol table is massaged once again,
this time to create the canonical table used by the BFD application.
Each symbol is inspected in turn, and a decision made (using the
`sclass' field) about the various flags to set in the `asymbol'.
*Note Symbols::. The generated canonical table shares strings with
the hidden internal symbol table.  Any linenumbers are read from
the coff file too, and attached to the symbols which own the
functions the linenumbers belong to. 

3.3.2.5 Symbol writing
......................

Writing a symbol to a coff file which didn't come from a coff file
will lose any debugging information. The `asymbol' structure
remembers the BFD from which the symbol was taken, and on output the
back end makes sure that the same destination target as source target
is present.  When the symbols have come from a coff file then all
the debugging information is preserved.  Symbol tables are
provided for writing to the back end in a vector of pointers to
pointers. This allows applications like the linker to accumulate and
output large symbol tables without having to do too much byte
copying.  This function runs through the provided symbol table and
patches each symbol marked as a file place holder (`C_FILE') to point
to the next file place holder in the list. It also marks each
`offset' field in the list with the offset from the first symbol of
the current symbol.  Another function of this procedure is to turn
the canonical value form of BFD into the form used by coff.
Internally, BFD expects symbol values to be offsets from a section
base; so a symbol physically at 0x120, but in a section starting at
0x100, would have the value 0x20. Coff expects symbols to contain
their final value, so symbols have their values changed at this point
to reflect their sum with their owning section.  This transformation
uses the `output_section' field of the `asymbol''s `asection' *Note
Sections::. 
     

   * `coff_mangle_symbols'
   This routine runs though the provided symbol table and uses the
offsets generated by the previous pass and the pointers generated
when the symbol table was read in to create the structured hierarchy
required by coff. It changes each pointer to a symbol into the index
into the symbol table of the asymbol. 
     

   * `coff_write_symbols'
   This routine runs through the symbol table and patches up the
symbols from their internal form into the coff way, calls the bit
twiddlers, and writes out the table to the file.  

3.3.2.6 `coff_symbol_type'

          from the file. */
       union
       {
         union internal_auxent auxent;
         struct internal_syment syment;
       } u;
     } combined_entry_type;
     
     
     /* Each canonical asymbol really looks like this: */
     
     typedef struct coff_symbol_struct
     {

       asymbol symbol;

3.3.2.8 Writing relocations
...........................

To write relocations, the back end steps though the canonical
relocation table and create an `internal_reloc'. The symbol index to
use is removed from the `offset' field in the symbol table supplied.
The address comes directly from the sum of the section base address
and the relocation offset; the type is dug directly from the howto
field.  Then the `internal_reloc' is swapped into the shape of an
`external_reloc' and written out to disk. 

3.3.2.9 Reading linenumbers
...........................

Creating the linenumber table is done by reading in the entire coff
linenumber table, and creating another table for internal use.  A
coff linenumber table is structured so that each function is marked
as having a line number of 0. Each line within the function is an
offset from the first line in the function. The base of the line
number information for the table is stored in the symbol associated
with the function.  Note: The PE format uses line number 0 for a
flag indicating a new source file.  The information is copied
from the external to the internal table, and each symbol which marks
a function is marked by pointing its...  How does this work ? 

3.3.2.10 Reading relocations
............................

Coff relocations are easily transformed into the internal BFD form
(`arelent').  Reading a coff relocation table is done in the
following stages: 
     

   * Read the entire coff relocation table into memory. 

   * Process each relocation in turn; first swap it from the external
     to the internal form. 

   * Turn the symbol referenced in the relocation's symbol index into
     a pointer into the canonical symbol table. This table is the
     same as the one returned by a call to `bfd_canonicalize_symtab'.
     The back end will call that routine and save the result if a
     canonicalization hasn't been done. 

   * The reloc index is turned into a pointer to a howto structure,
     in a back end specific way. For instance, the 386 and 960 use
     the `r_type' to directly produce an index into a howto table
     vector; the 88k subtracts a number from the `r_type' field and
     creates an addend field.

3.4 ELF backends
================

BFD support for ELF formats is being worked on. Currently, the best
supported back ends are for sparc and i386 (running svr4 or Solaris
2).  Documentation of the internals of the support code still
needs to be written.  The code is changing quickly enough that we
haven't bothered yet.

3.5 mmo backend
===============

The mmo object format is used exclusively together with Professor
Donald E. Knuth's educational 64-bit processor MMIX.  The simulator
`mmix' which is available at
`http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs/mmix.tar.gz'
understands this format.  That package also includes a combined
assembler and linker called `mmixal'.  The mmo format has no
advantages feature-wise compared to e.g. ELF.  It is a simple
non-relocatable object format with no support for archives or
debugging information, except for symbol value information and line
numbers (which is not yet implemented in BFD).  See
`http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix.html' for more
information about MMIX.  The ELF format is used for intermediate
object files in the BFD implementation.

File: bfd.info,  Node: File layout,  Next: Symbol-table,  Prev: mmo,  Up: mmo

3.5.1 File layout
-----------------

The mmo file contents is not partitioned into named sections as with
e.g. ELF.  Memory areas is formed by specifying the location of the
data that follows.  Only the memory area `0x0000...00' to
`0x01ff...ff' is executable, so it is used for code (and constants)
and the area `0x2000...00' to `0x20ff...ff' is used for writable
data.  *Note mmo section mapping::.  There is provision for
specifying "special data" of 65536 different types.  We use type 80
(decimal), arbitrarily chosen the same as the ELF `e_machine' number
for MMIX, filling it with section information normally found in ELF
objects. *Note mmo section mapping::.  Contents is entered as
32-bit words, xor:ed over previous contents, always zero-initialized.
A word that starts with the byte `0x98' forms a command called a
`lopcode', where the next byte distinguished between the thirteen
lopcodes.  The two remaining bytes, called the `Y' and `Z' fields,
or the `YZ' field (a 16-bit big-endian number), are used for
various purposes different for each lopcode.  As documented in
`http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmixal-intro.ps.gz', the
lopcodes are: 
`lop_quote'
     0x98000001.  The next word is contents, regardless of whether it
     starts with 0x98 or not. 

`lop_loc'
     0x9801YYZZ, where `Z' is 1 or 2.  This is a location directive,
     setting the location for the next data to the next 32-bit word
     (for Z = 1) or 64-bit word (for Z = 2), plus Y * 2^56.  Normally
     `Y' is 0 for the text segment and 2 for the data segment. 

`lop_skip'
     0x9802YYZZ.  Increase the current location by `YZ' bytes. 

`lop_fixo'
     0x9803YYZZ, where `Z' is 1 or 2.  Store the current location as
     64 bits into the location pointed to by the next 32-bit (Z = 1)
     or 64-bit (Z = 2) word, plus Y * 2^56. 

`lop_fixr'
     0x9804YYZZ.  `YZ' is stored into the current location plus 2 - 4
     * YZ. 

`lop_fixrx'
     0x980500ZZ.  `Z' is 16 or 24.  A value `L' derived from the
     following 32-bit word are used in a manner similar to `YZ' in
     lop_fixr: it is xor:ed into the current location minus 4 * L.
     The first byte of the word is 0 or 1.  If it is 1, then L =
     (LOWEST 24 BITS OF WORD) - 2^Z, if 0, then L = (LOWEST 24 BITS
     OF WORD). 

`lop_file'
     0x9806YYZZ.  `Y' is the file number, `Z' is count of 32-bit
     words.  Set the file number to `Y' and the line counter to 0.
     The next Z * 4 bytes contain the file name, padded with zeros if
     the count is not a multiple of four.  The same `Y' may occur
     multiple times, but `Z' must be 0 for all but the first
     occurrence. 

`lop_line'
     0x9807YYZZ.  `YZ' is the line number.  Together with lop_file,
     it forms the source location for the next 32-bit word. Note that
     for each non-lopcode 32-bit word, line numbers are assumed
     incremented by one. 

`lop_spec'
     0x9808YYZZ.  `YZ' is the type number.  Data until the next
     lopcode other than lop_quote forms special data of type `YZ'.
     *Note mmo section mapping::.  Other types than 80, (or type 80
     with a content that does not parse) is stored in sections named
     `.MMIX.spec_data.N' where N is the `YZ'-type.  The flags for
     such a sections say not to allocate or load the data.  The vma
     is 0. Contents of multiple occurrences of special data N is
     concatenated to the data of the previous lop_spec Ns.  The
     location in data or code at which the lop_spec occurred is lost.
     

`lop_pre'
     0x980901ZZ.  The first lopcode in a file.  The `Z' field forms
     the length of header information in 32-bit words, where the
     first word tells the time in seconds since `00:00:00 GMT Jan 1
     1970'. 

`lop_post'
     0x980a00ZZ.  Z > 32.  This lopcode follows after all
     content-generating lopcodes in a program.  The `Z' field denotes
     the value of `rG' at the beginning of the program. The following
     256 - Z big-endian 64-bit words are loaded into global registers
     `$G' ... `$255'. 

`lop_stab'
     0x980b0000.  The next-to-last lopcode in a program.  Must follow
     immediately after the lop_post lopcode and its data.  After this
     lopcode follows all symbols in a compressed format (*note
     Symbol-table::). 

`lop_end'
     0x980cYYZZ.  The last lopcode in a program.  It must follow the
     lop_stab lopcode and its data.  The `YZ' field contains the
     number of 32-bit words of symbol table information after the
     preceding lop_stab lopcode.
    Note that the lopcode "fixups"; `lop_fixr', `lop_fixrx' and
`lop_fixo' are not generated by BFD, but are handled.  They are
generated by `mmixal'.  This trivial one-label, one-instruction
file: 
      :Main TRAP 1,2,3
    can be represented this way in mmo: 
      0x98090101 - lop_pre, one 32-bit word with timestamp.
      <timestamp>
      0x98010002 - lop_loc, text segment, using a 64-bit address.
                   Note that mmixal does not emit this for the file above.
      0x00000000 - Address, high 32 bits.
      0x00000000 - Address, low 32 bits.
      0x98060002 - lop_file, 2 32-bit words for file-name.
      0x74657374 - "test"
      0x2e730000 - ".s\0\0"
      0x98070001 - lop_line, line 1.
      0x00010203 - TRAP 1,2,3
      0x980a00ff - lop_post, setting $255 to 0.
      0x00000000
      0x00000000
      0x980b0000 - lop_stab for ":Main" = 0, serial 1.
      0x203a4040   *Note Symbol-table::.
      0x10404020
      0x4d206120
      0x69016e00
      0x81000000
      0x980c0005 - lop_end; symbol table contained five 32-bit words.

3.5.2 Symbol table format
-------------------------

From mmixal.w (or really, the generated mmixal.tex) in
`http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs/mmix.tar.gz'):
"Symbols are stored and retrieved by means of a `ternary search
trie', following ideas of Bentley and Sedgewick. (See ACM-SIAM Symp.
on Discrete Algorithms `8' (1997), 360-369; R.Sedgewick, `Algorithms
in C' (Reading, Mass. Addison-Wesley, 1998), `15.4'.)  Each trie node
stores a character, and there are branches to subtries for the cases
where a given character is less than, equal to, or greater than the
character in the trie.  There also is a pointer to a symbol table
entry if a symbol ends at the current node."  So it's a tree
encoded as a stream of bytes.  The stream of bytes acts on a single
virtual global symbol, adding and removing characters and signalling
complete symbol points.  Here, we read the stream and create symbols
at the completion points.  First, there's a control byte `m'.  If
any of the listed bits in `m' is nonzero, we execute what stands at
the right, in the listed order: 
      (MMO3_LEFT)
      0x40 - Traverse left trie.
             (Read a new command byte and recurse.)
     
      (MMO3_SYMBITS)
      0x2f - Read the next byte as a character and store it in the
             current character position; increment character position.
             Test the bits of `m':
     
             (MMO3_WCHAR)
             0x80 - The character is 16-bit (so read another byte,
                    merge into current character.
     
             (MMO3_TYPEBITS)
             0xf  - We have a complete symbol; parse the type, value
                    and serial number and do what should be done
                    with a symbol.  The type and length information
                    is in j = (m & 0xf).
     
                    (MMO3_REGQUAL_BITS)
                    j == 0xf: A register variable.  The following
                              byte tells which register.
                    j <= 8:   An absolute symbol.  Read j bytes as the
                              big-endian number the symbol equals.
                              A j = 2 with two zero bytes denotes an
                              unknown symbol.
                    j > 8:    As with j <= 8, but add (0x20 << 56)
                              to the value in the following j - 8
                              bytes.
     
                    Then comes the serial number, as a variant of
                    uleb128, but better named ubeb128:
                    Read bytes and shift the previous value left 7
                    (multiply by 128).  Add in the new byte, repeat
                    until a byte has bit 7 set.  The serial number
                    is the computed value minus 128.
     
             (MMO3_MIDDLE)
             0x20 - Traverse middle trie.  (Read a new command byte
                    and recurse.)  Decrement character position.
     
      (MMO3_RIGHT)
      0x10 - Traverse right trie.  (Read a new command byte and
             recurse.)
    Let's look again at the `lop_stab' for the trivial file (*note
File layout::). 
      0x980b0000 - lop_stab for ":Main" = 0, serial 1.
      0x203a4040
      0x10404020
      0x4d206120
      0x69016e00
      0x81000000
    This forms the trivial trie (note that the path between ":" and
"M" is redundant): 
      203a     ":"
      40       /
      40      /
      10      \
      40      /
      40     /
      204d  "M"
      2061  "a"
      2069  "i"
      016e  "n" is the last character in a full symbol, and
            with a value represented in one byte.
      00    The value is 0.
      81    The serial number is 1.

3.5.3 mmo section mapping
-------------------------

The implementation in BFD uses special data type 80 (decimal) to
encapsulate and describe named sections, containing e.g. debug
information.  If needed, any datum in the encapsulation will be
quoted using lop_quote.  First comes a 32-bit word holding the number
of 32-bit words containing the zero-terminated zero-padded segment
name.  After the name there's a 32-bit word holding flags describing
the section type.  Then comes a 64-bit big-endian word with the
section length (in bytes), then another with the section start
address.  Depending on the type of section, the contents might
follow, zero-padded to 32-bit boundary.  For a loadable section (such
as data or code), the contents might follow at some later point, not
necessarily immediately, as a lop_loc with the same start address as
in the section description, followed by the contents.  This in effect
forms a descriptor that must be emitted before the actual contents.
Sections described this way must not overlap.  For areas that
don't have such descriptors, synthetic sections are formed by BFD.
Consecutive contents in the two memory areas `0x0000...00' to
`0x01ff...ff' and `0x2000...00' to `0x20ff...ff' are entered in
sections named `.text' and `.data' respectively.  If an area is not
otherwise described, but would together with a neighboring lower area
be less than `0x40000000' bytes long, it is joined with the lower
area and the gap is zero-filled.  For other cases, a new section is
formed, named `.MMIX.sec.N'.  Here, N is a number, a running count
through the mmo file, starting at 0.  A loadable section
specified as: 
      .section secname,"ax"
      TETRA 1,2,3,4,-1,-2009
      BYTE 80
    and linked to address `0x4', is represented by the sequence: 
      0x98080050 - lop_spec 80
      0x00000002 - two 32-bit words for the section name
      0x7365636e - "secn"
      0x616d6500 - "ame\0"
      0x00000033 - flags CODE, READONLY, LOAD, ALLOC
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of section length
      0x0000001c - section length is 28 bytes; 6 * 4 + 1 + alignment to 32 bits
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of section address
      0x00000004 - section address is 4
      0x98010002 - 64 bits with address of following data
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of address
      0x00000004 - low 32 bits: data starts at address 4
      0x00000001 - 1
      0x00000002 - 2
      0x00000003 - 3
      0x00000004 - 4
      0xffffffff - -1
      0xfffff827 - -2009
      0x50000000 - 80 as a byte, padded with zeros.
    Note that the lop_spec wrapping does not include the section
contents.  Compare this to a non-loaded section specified as: 
      .section thirdsec
      TETRA 200001,100002
      BYTE 38,40
    This, when linked to address `0x200000000000001c', is
represented by: 
      0x98080050 - lop_spec 80
      0x00000002 - two 32-bit words for the section name
      0x7365636e - "thir"
      0x616d6500 - "dsec"
      0x00000010 - flag READONLY
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of section length
      0x0000000c - section length is 12 bytes; 2 * 4 + 2 + alignment to 32 bits
      0x20000000 - high 32 bits of address
      0x0000001c - low 32 bits of address 0x200000000000001c
      0x00030d41 - 200001
      0x000186a2 - 100002
      0x26280000 - 38, 40 as bytes, padded with zeros
    For the latter example, the section contents must not be loaded
in memory, and is therefore specified as part of the special data.
The address is usually unimportant but might provide information for
e.g. the DWARF 2 debugging format.

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
