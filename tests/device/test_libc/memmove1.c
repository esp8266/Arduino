/* Test moves of 0..MAX bytes; overlapping-src-higher,
   overlapping-src-lower and non-overlapping.  The overlap varies with
   1..N where N is the size moved.  This means an order of MAX**2
   iterations.  The size of an octet may seem appropriate for MAX and
   makes an upper limit for simple testing.  For the CRIS simulator,
   making this 256 added 90s to the test-run (2GHz P4) while 64 (4s) was
   enough to spot the bugs that had crept in, hence the number chosen.  */
